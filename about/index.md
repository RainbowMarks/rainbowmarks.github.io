<img src="{% picture direct200 img/MidSouthHeadshot-1.jpg %}" align="right" alt="Chris Hammond of RainbowMarks Photography" />RainbowMarks Photography is one of the homes of <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com" target="_blank">Chris Hammond</a>. The name RainbowMarks comes from Rainbow Landmarks, one of the great (if I do say so myself) photos was the shot above of the Sydney Opera House on a trip to Australia in 2012.

The double rainbow presented itself over the harbor and I couldn't resist running around to get the perfect angle on the Opera House. A couple of years later, while visiting San Francisco, I happened to catch a rainbow over the Golden Gate Bridge.

The combination of these two events and the works produced gave us the name to use for our photography business.

Do you have an event (bike, car, running, crossfit) that you would like me to attend? [Feel free to reach out and see if schedules align](https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact). 

I hope you enjoy my work!
