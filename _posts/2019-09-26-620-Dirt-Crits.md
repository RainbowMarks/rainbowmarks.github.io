In late June RainbowMarks went to Castlewood State Park here in St. Louis County and took pictures at the Two Timing Guys Dirt Crits.

This was our first time exploring Castlewood, and was scouting for our first attempt at running the dirt crits ourselves later in the summer.

Currently the photos are uploaded to Facebook, so we can't embed them here, but you can [check them out in the Facebook Album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1618354151631438).
