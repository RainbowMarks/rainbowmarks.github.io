What's new for 2023?

We're working on some website updates, stay tuned for those!

If you're looking for an event photographer around St. Louis you've come to the right place! Be sure to check out our [Events page](/events/) for more information.

## What events will we be at in 2023? 
We haven't quite decided all the events that we will be at this year, but we will most definitely be at Unbound Gravel in June in Emporia Kansas. We'll be riding in the 100 mile race, but hopefully out after that taking photos at night of riders. 

Also be sure to keep an eye out for us at Autocross events around St. Louis this summer.
