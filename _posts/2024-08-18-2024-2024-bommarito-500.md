I had the pleasure of once again getting to wander around World Wide Technology Raceway for the IndyCar event this weekend, the Bommarito 500! The race was held on August 17th, 2024 in Madison, Illinois.

[My first IndyCar experience was back in 2021](https://rainbowmarks.com/Events/2021/08/August-21-2021-IndyCar-Race-At-WWT-Raceway) and this time hoped to improve on the shots I took during that race. 

I was fortunate enough to have access to the VIP suites building and planted myself on the top of the roof for the start of the race.

From there I wandered down into the infield and spent the majority of the race along the fence in turn 3. Many of the turn 3 shots are fairly repetitive but I was over there trying to see what I could make the camera do and how the setting sun would effect things.

Towards the end of the race I made my way back over near the front straight to see if I could get anywhere close to the finish for some shots but ended up not getting anything there worth posting, perhaps next time!

Here in the gallery we have a handful of shots, [check out the main gallery for 200 photos from the race](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Bommarito-500)!
