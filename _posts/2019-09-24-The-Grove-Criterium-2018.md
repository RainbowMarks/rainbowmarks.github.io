In August of 2018 I went down to &quot;The Grove&quot; here in St. Louis and shot a criterium (bicycle race). Check out some of the shots from that event. I started taking photos at bike races many years ago, and have shot them in Missouri, Colorado and California. They defintely create some of the coolest photos, I hope to shoot more in the future.
