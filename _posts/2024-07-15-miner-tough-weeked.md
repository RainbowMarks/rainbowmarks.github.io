Year four! of shooting the Miner Tough weekend down in St. Joe State Park here in Missouri kicked off with Trail Run on Saturday July 13th, 2024, followed by the Mountain Bike Race on Sunday July 14th.

Like last year, the event chose to have our photo services available for everyone to have access to free photo downloads! You can [find the photos from the Miner Tough Weekend events now](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend)!

You'll find three different galleries, I tried to get a photo of every entrant but likely missed a few:

1. [Trail Run on Saturday](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Saturday-Trail-Run)
2. [Mountain Bike Race on Sunday](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Sunday-Mountain-Bike-Race)
3. [GoPro random shots from the MTB Race](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Sunday-MTB-GoPro-Randomness) The camera was sitting next to a tree taking a photo every second. If you happened to pass at the right time to get in the frame and the photo wasn't the blurriest thing ever created you might find yourself in these.

If you would like you can order prints from our online galleries.

A big thanks to the event organizers for having us out again this year!
