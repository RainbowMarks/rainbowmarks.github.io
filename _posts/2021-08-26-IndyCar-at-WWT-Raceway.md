Saturday August 21st, 2021 I grabbed the camera gear and headed out to World Wide Technology Raceway in Madison Illinois. I couldn't talk anyone from my family to join me, so I was free to wander around the facility and shoot photos of the Indy Car Race. 

I had a blast, and have a bunch of [photos available](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2021/Cars/2021-Indy-Cars-at-WWT-Raceway)
