Get ready, motorsport enthusiasts! RainbowMarks Photography is thrilled to announce our coverage of the 2024 Tire Rack SCCA Solo Nationals in Lincoln, Nebraska. This iconic event is the pinnacle of Solo competition, and we're geared up to capture the high-octane action from start to finish.

{% picture  /img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow.jpg --link https://rainbowmarks.square.site/product/2024-solo-nationals/4 %}

## Capturing Every Moment
We'll be on-site shooting as many competition runs as possible across the four days of the event. Our focus is on action shots that showcase the speed, precision, and thrill of Solo racing. Whether you're a competitor looking to relive your best runs or a fan wanting to see the action up close, we've got you covered.

## Pre-Event Special Package
For those who want comprehensive coverage of their performance, we're offering an exclusive **Pre-Event Special Package**:
- **$125** for every one of our published digital photos of your car from the 2024 Solo Nationals. (Individual photos will be $25/photo after the event)
- This package includes all photos, no matter how many drivers or classes the car is entered in.
- Automatically sorted, tagged and filtered photos for you and your car, no need to "search" through photos after the event.
- We'll be specifically shooting cars that have prepaid! We will guarantee at least 5 individual photos for you (likely many more), or your money back! Everyone else comes second, we may or may not get photos of them!
- 25% Discount on any Physical Orders (coupon code will be provided via email after 2024 Solo Nationals galleries are posted)
- ProSolo Finale shots can be included for an additional **$50** even after the Finale!


### To maximize our success in capturing your car, please provide us with the following details when checking out:
- **Car number**
- **Class**
- **Make/Model/Color**

This information helps us focus on your vehicle throughout the event, ensuring we get the best possible shots.

**You can book this package online via [this link](https://rainbowmarks.square.site/product/2024-solo-nationals/4).**

## Years of Solo Nationals Photo Experience
I started attending the Solo Nationals in 2000. Throughout the years I've taken thousands upon thousands of competition photos at the event. [Check out some of the past years work in our Flickr Galleries](https://flickr.com/search/?user_id=17726343%40N00&view_all=1&text=nationals)

## Post-Event Photo Availability
If you decide to purchase photos after the event, individual photos will be available for **$25/photo**. However, securing the pre-event package guarantees you receive all available photos at a significant discount.

## Important Note
As of right now, we will be running and working the final heat each day, which may limit our ability to shoot cars competing in those classes. We'll do our best to capture as much as we can, but please be aware of this potential limitation.

## Contact Us
If you have any questions or need to provide us with your car details, feel free to reach out before the event. We're excited to capture the excitement of Solo Nationals and can't wait to see you in Lincoln!
