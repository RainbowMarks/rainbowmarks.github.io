It has been a few months since my last post, been primarily shooting kids hockey games since the last post, though stay tuned for another post soon with some travel photos.

This week after the Christmas Holiday we had the Holiday Jamboree at the Maryville University Hockey Center. 

The Chesterfield 8U White Team that was thrown together at the last minute played 5 games, ultimately going 3-2.
