It has been a few years since I was able to attend the Gateway Cup Bicycle Races due to typically being in Lincoln Nebraska over Labor Day weekend, but with staying home this year I was able to get out for a couple of the days of the four day criterium races in St. Louis.

We have posted over 400 photos in our Galleries available for purchase. You will find them organized by race group for easier browsing.

## Friday Night Tour De Lafayette
Friday night was drizzly and dark, things that make for a great bike race, or at least cool photos! I shot both the Men's and Women's Pro/1 races.

## Saturday Tour De Francis
Saturday was also overcast, but without the drizzle when we were at Francis park. The sun even popped out for a minute as I was leaving.
