I'm an Air Force brat, that means I love air shows, so when the Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo come to town every 2 years I am in heaven for the week. I am fortunate enough to live close enough to the airport that I often see performers fly over my house when they arrive and when they are practicing on Thursday and Friday.

This week was no different, after getting back from our trip to NYC super early on Thursday morning I was pleasantly notified by my wife around 10am on Thursday that jets were up and flying. I was able to step outside and see the Boeing F-15EX (or was it a QA?) flying over, close enough that I could snap a decent photo with my cell phone.

I spent the afternoon Thursday running in and out of the house camera in hand trying to get photos of planes as they flew over while simultaneously trying to get work done throughout the day.

Friday I was able to view quite a bit of the practices flights that occurred from up off of Wildhorse Creek Road in Chesterfield, followed by spending the entire day Saturday sitting just past the end of the runway at Spirit Airport to catch the performers in action.

Over the past 4 days I took nearly thirteen thousand photos and have spent a considerable amount of time culling down to a manageable list of photos that I thought could be published. 

You will find a small selection of those published photos here, and the rest in our [online gallery for the Spirit of St. Louis Air Show & STEM Expo](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Spirit-Of-St-Louis-Air-Show-Stem-Expo).

Stay tuned as we work on some special print promotions from the Air Show later this month.
