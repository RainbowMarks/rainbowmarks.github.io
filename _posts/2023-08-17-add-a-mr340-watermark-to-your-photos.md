## PhotoMark.co has gone into hybernation as of 9/30/2023. It may be revived again in the future.

A few weeks before the 2023 MR340 I posted in the Facebook group asking if people wanted the MR340 logo overlaid on the photos from the event. The response was mixed, probably around 50/50, with some people wanting it, and others preferring not to have it.

I err'd on the side of not including the logo on the photos that were made available for purchase from the event, but had every intention of figuring out a way to allow the people who wanted the logo, to add the logo, post purchase.


Well, I am proud to announce I've come up with a way for you to do that! 

Introducing [PHOTOMARK.CO](/), a simple way for you to add the MR340 logo to your photos from the event. The basics are:

1. [Visit the website](/photomark/).
2. Upload your photo. 
3. Choose your Logo option (black and gray).
4. Download the newly generated photo!

It's that simple! Though you will need to do this one at a time for each photo you want to add the logo to.

If you haven't purchased any MR340 photos yet, you can [do so here](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2023/Watersports/MR340).

Currently the website is pretty simple, allowing you to choose only from the 2023 MR340 logo options, in the future I might make it a little more customizable to support future, and past, events! 

This is 100% brand new, custom code, so if you run into any problems, [please don't hesitate to reach out](https://cjh.am/rbmcontact) with feedback!
