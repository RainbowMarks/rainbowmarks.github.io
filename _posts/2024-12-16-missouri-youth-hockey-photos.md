As a photographer, I've spent the past five years immersed in the fast-paced, adrenaline-filled world of youth hockey. Shooting youth hockey games across Missouri has become a passion of mine, combining my love for sports, photography, and storytelling. In this post, I want to share my experience capturing these unforgettable moments and some tips for parents and fans looking to preserve memories of their favorite players.

## The Thrill of Youth Hockey

Missouri youth hockey is full of energy, determination, and heart. Whether it's a young goalie making an incredible save, a forward scoring the game-winning goal, or players cheering each other on after a tough period, the spirit of these athletes is inspiring. Every game tells its own story, and my goal as a photographer is to capture the essence of those stories.

## The Challenges of Shooting Hockey

Hockey is one of the most challenging sports to photograph. The speed of the game, the unpredictable action, and the reflections from the ice and glass all require a skilled hand and the right gear. Over the years, I've fine-tuned my approach to deal with these challenges:

- **Gear**: I primarily use a Canon EOS R5 paired with a fast telephoto lens to freeze the action. For poorly lit rinks, my gear's ability to perform well in low light has been crucial.
- **Settings**: High shutter speeds (1/640 or faster), wide apertures, and ISO adjustments are essential to capturing crisp shots in dimly lit arenas.
- **Positioning**: Knowing where to stand is just as important as technical skills. Being at the right angle for a shot—whether it's behind the net, at center ice, or near the benches—makes all the difference.

## Moments That Matter

What makes youth hockey special are the moments of pure joy and camaraderie. Some of my favorite shots over the years include:

- A goalie's celebration after their team clinched a championship.
- A team's huddle before a big game, reflecting their determination.
- Players sharing high-fives and laughter after a well-fought match.

These aren't just pictures—they're memories. I love knowing that the images I capture will be cherished by families for years to come.

## Tips for Parents Capturing Hockey Photos

If you're a parent looking to take your own photos at the rink, here are a few tips:

1. **Use Fast Shutter Speeds**: To avoid motion blur, set your camera to a high shutter speed.
2. **Focus on Faces**: Hockey is about emotion. Capturing the players' expressions through their cages adds depth to your photos.
3. **Be Patient**: Hockey moves quickly, so wait for the right moment—a breakaway, a big save, or a celebration.
4. **Edit Thoughtfully**: Post-processing can help bring out details, especially in challenging lighting conditions.

## Why I Do It

Youth hockey photography is more than just a job; it's a privilege. Being able to witness and document these young athletes' growth, determination, and sportsmanship is truly rewarding. Over the years, I've seen players develop not just as athletes but as individuals, and I'm honored to be a part of preserving their journeys.
