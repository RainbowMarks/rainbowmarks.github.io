Photos from the 2025 Wickenheiser Cup where Rockwood Summit High School faced off against Parkway South High School at Centene Community Center.

It was a close game until midway through the third, Parkway South was up 1-0 when Rockwood Summit was able to tie it up with a goal!

After that however the wheels fell off the Rockwood Summit bus and Parkway South quickly put two more goals on the board to give themselves a lead and the momentum for the final few minutes of the game.

Congrats to both Rockwood Summit and Parkway South for the great seasons!
