This weekend I had the pleasure of shooting team photos for a local Mountain Bike team, part of the Missouri Interscholastic Cycling League NICA (National Interscholastic Cycling Association).

In the gallery here on this page are a couple of the results along with a link to the larger gallery. If you're MTB Team is ready for a photo shoot [be sure to reach out ASAP](https://forms.gle/nW53hFmwBrNjqdg96)!
