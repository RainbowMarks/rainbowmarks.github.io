On Sunday morning, the 21st of January, I headed up to Clarksville Missouri to look for Bald Eagles along the Mississippi River.

I arrived just after sunrise (next time I'll leave earlier) and immediately saw two Bald Eagles flying just north of the lock and dam. I knew it was going to be a good day.

I parked in the public parking near the lock and dam and immediately started getting my equipment ready to get setup. I took a monopod, instead of a tripod for the day, though I am not sure if that was the best choice. 

Other photographers who were there had tripods, while I had a little more mobility than they did, I feel like I could have used the stability of a tripod. I'll have to try that next time. 

It was a rather cold morning, and while I thought I was prepared for the chill, I wasn't. Next time I'll go I'll be sure to take a mask and better gloves with me. 

The Eagles south of the damn were pretty active just after sunrise, with bursts of activity as they were trying to find fish in the river.

After an hour or so in Clarksville, I headed south on 79. I ended up driving through Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge. I also stopped for a bit in Winfield, Missouri and found a few more Bald Eagles hunting there.

Here in the gallery you can see a couple of the shots I was able to capture, I look forward to going back again soon.

I've posted a 36 megabyte image that has 99 shots of one particular Bald Eagle going through the motions of catching and flying off with a fish. You can see the full high resolution photo here: [Bald Eagle Catching Fish](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/img/Birds2024-2.jpg)
