<p>In late June RainbowMarks went to Castlewood State&nbsp;Park here in St. Louis County and took pictures at the Two Timing Guys Dirt Crits.</p>
<p>This was our first time exploring Castlewood, and was scouting for our first attempt at running the dirt crits ourselves later in the summer.</p>
<p>Currently the photos are uploaded to Facebook, so we can&#39;t embed them here, but you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/rainbowmarksphoto/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1618354151631438" target="_blank">check them out in the Facebook Album</a> until we get them up on Flickr.</p>
