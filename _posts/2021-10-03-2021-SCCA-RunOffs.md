I took my son out to Indianapolis Motor Speedway over the weekend to catch the Sunday races of the 2021 SCCA RunOffs. We had a blast out there, I may have been to IMS once about 29 years ago for a tour, but this was the first time there catching any racing.

I'm still working on my road racing shots, so while I took a few thousand photos, I pruned thousands of them out for being too blurry based on me playing around with camera settings. Even if you don't find your car here, I might have a shot of you, [feel free to reach out](https://chrishammond.com/contact/).

## Photo Size
Photos were shot on a Canon R5, with a 43 megapixel sensor. 99% of the photos posted have NOT been cropped, they are very large, so you can crop them and still get a great photo if you want to clean up any open space.
