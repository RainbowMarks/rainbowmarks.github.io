This weekend I shot my first CrossFit competition since the [2019 CrossFit Games](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/CrossFit/2019-CrossFit-Games). I was asked to come out to CrossFit Wildwood to shoot the Midwest Masters Experience event. The event was great, with 60+ teams out there, all of the entrants 35+ (I believe) with the oldest being 72.

## Purchasing Photos
For this event, the digital downloads are free, but you need a password to access them (see how to get the password below)! You can still purchase prints and other items from within the galleries.

## Password To Download
I'm trying something new out here, in order to access the digital downloads you need a password, [you can get one by filling out the form here](/passwords), once you provide your email address you will be provided the password that allows you to download the files. When viewing the galleries you can choose the Download option next to a photo to download the high resolution version of that photo without any watermarks.

## Photo Size
Photos were shot on a Canon R5, with a 43 megapixel sensor. 99% of the photos posted have NOT been cropped, they are very large, so you can crop them and still get a great photo if you want to clean up any open space.
