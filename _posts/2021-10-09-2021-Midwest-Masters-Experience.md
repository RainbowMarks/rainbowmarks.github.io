This weekend I shot my first CrossFit competition since the [2019 CrossFit Games](https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/CrossFit/2019-CrossFit-Games). I was asked to come out to CrossFit Wildwood to shoot the Midwest Masters Experience event. The event was great, with 60+ teams out there, all of the entrants 35+ (I believe) with the oldest being 72.

## Photo Size
Photos were shot on a Canon R5, with a 43 megapixel sensor. 99% of the photos posted have NOT been cropped, they are very large, so you can crop them and still get a great photo if you want to clean up any open space.
