I was out at Indian Camp Creek park on 8/15/2021 shooting photos of the ICC Challenge mountain bike race. I tried to get a shot of everyone, I likely missed at least a few folks, but I've posted 3870 photos organized into three galleries.

## Find Your Photos

Use the "search" on my Gallery site to more easily find your photos by Bib number, I manually tagged every picture with a bib number if I could read your number plate, if not, sorry you didn't get tagged.
