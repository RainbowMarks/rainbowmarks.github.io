The August 8th dirt crits took us to the crit course in Valley Park, Missouri. These shots were taken after Chris competed in the C race, his first time doing so.

The dirt crits in Valley Park have been previously organized by Two Timing Guys, headed up by Matt Struckman. Matt along with others built the course in Valley Park with the approval of the city and have put hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of their own personal time into maintaining the track for people to ride any time they like.
