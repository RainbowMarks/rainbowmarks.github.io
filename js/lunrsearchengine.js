    "title": "About",
    "body": "RainbowMarks Photography is a project from Chris Hammond. The name RainbowMarks comes from Rainbow Landmarks, one of the great (if I do say so myself) photos I‚Äôve taken was the photo here on this page of the Sydney Opera House on a trip to Australia in 2012. The double rainbow presented itself over the harbor and I couldn‚Äôt resist running around to get the perfect angle on the Opera House. A couple of years later, while visiting San Francisco, I happened to catch a rainbow over the Golden Gate Bridge. The combination of these two events and the works produced gave me the name to use for my photography business. I‚Äôve been taking digital photos for over 26 years and have been shooting automotive events for nearly that entire time! Do you have an event (bike, car, running, crossfit) that you would like me to attend? Feel free to reach out and see if schedules align. I hope you enjoy my work!

    "title": "Capturing the Action: Missouri Youth Hockey Photos",
    "body": "2024/12/16 - As a photographer, I‚Äôve spent the past five years immersed in the fast-paced, adrenaline-filled world of youth hockey. Shooting youth hockey games across Missouri has become a passion of mine, combining my love for sports, photography, and storytelling. In this post, I want to share my experience capturing these unforgettable moments and some tips for parents and fans looking to preserve memories of their favorite players. The Thrill of Youth Hockey: Missouri youth hockey is full of energy, determination, and heart. Whether it‚Äôs a young goalie making an incredible save, a forward scoring the game-winning goal, or players cheering each other on after a tough period, the spirit of these athletes is inspiring. Every game tells its own story, and my goal as a photographer is to capture the essence of those stories. The Challenges of Shooting Hockey: Hockey is one of the most challenging sports to photograph. The speed of the game, the unpredictable action, and the reflections from the ice and glass all require a skilled hand and the right gear. Over the years, I‚Äôve fine-tuned my approach to deal with these challenges:  Gear: I primarily use a Canon EOS R5 paired with a fast telephoto lens to freeze the action. For poorly lit rinks, my gear‚Äôs ability to perform well in low light has been crucial.  Settings: High shutter speeds (1/640 or faster), wide apertures, and ISO adjustments are essential to capturing crisp shots in dimly lit arenas.  Positioning: Knowing where to stand is just as important as technical skills. Being at the right angle for a shot‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs behind the net, at center ice, or near the benches‚Äîmakes all the difference. Moments That Matter: What makes youth hockey special are the moments of pure joy and camaraderie. Some of my favorite shots over the years include:  A goalie‚Äôs celebration after their team clinched a championship.  A team‚Äôs huddle before a big game, reflecting their determination.  Players sharing high-fives and laughter after a well-fought match. These aren‚Äôt just pictures‚Äîthey‚Äôre memories. I love knowing that the images I capture will be cherished by families for years to come. Tips for Parents Capturing Hockey Photos: If you‚Äôre a parent looking to take your own photos at the rink, here are a few tips:  Use Fast Shutter Speeds: To avoid motion blur, set your camera to a high shutter speed.  Focus on Faces: Hockey is about emotion. Capturing the players‚Äô expressions through their cages adds depth to your photos.  Be Patient: Hockey moves quickly, so wait for the right moment‚Äîa breakaway, a big save, or a celebration.  Edit Thoughtfully: Post-processing can help bring out details, especially in challenging lighting conditions. Why I Do It: Youth hockey photography is more than just a job; it‚Äôs a privilege. Being able to witness and document these young athletes‚Äô growth, determination, and sportsmanship is truly rewarding. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen players develop not just as athletes but as individuals, and I‚Äôm honored to be a part of preserving their journeys. If you‚Äôre interested in seeing my work or booking a session, feel free to reach out. Let‚Äôs create lasting memories of your hockey star! Happy shooting, and I‚Äôll see you at the rink! "

    "title": "Northern Lights over Missouri and the Mississipi River",
    "body": "2024/10/11 - Yesterday I posted about how to take photos of the Northern Lights, here are the results of my own process. Last night was a busy night. My wife has a dressage show this weekend, so I was doing the bachelor dad thing for the start of the evening. Running one kid to gymnastics and then taking the other to hockey practice. Before these two events I packed up all the camera gear I thought I was going to need for the evening. After hockey I grabbed a quick bite to eat and then transferred kid #2 to Natalie on her way home, and then I headed north. My goal was to try to get somewhere to see the northern lights with some water in the foreground. Looking at dark sky maps I considered heading to Mark Twain Lake, but I was concerned that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find a decent spot and that I would be too late by the time I got there. Instead, I headed up 79 towards Clarksville MO. On the way I looked up boat ramps and picked one in Clarksville. Upon arrival I decided there was too much extra light, so I continued one ramp north of Clarksville to a great little place (Silo Access Boat Ramp). When I pulled in, I realized it had some camping spots with a few folks in trailers and a car or two parked nearby. It was dark, and I was able to park pretty close to the Mississippi River. I quickly got out of the car and setup to take photos for a couple of hours. This aurora event was unlike any previous one I‚Äôve experienced (2 in the past 18 months). It was amazing. As my eyes adjusted to the dark sky the lights and colors really started to pop. To the point that I was getting distracted trying to get the cameras setup to just look and take it all in visually. The photos here are some of the selected photos taken on my Canon R5 with a 15-35mm lens. Here‚Äôs a timelapse of those and more photos all together: "

    "title": "How to Photograph the Northern Lights: A Guide to Capturing Nature‚Äôs Spectacular Light Show",
    "body": "2024/10/10 - With the recent influx of solar activity the ability for more parts of the United States to see the Northern Lights (aurora borealis) has increased many times over the past year. We are in a peak phase of sun activity this year and may continue to have opportunities for the near future, but you never know, so if you‚Äôve got an opportunity to get outside, do it! See some of the output from these tips The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are one of the most breathtaking natural phenomena to witness. Capturing them through photography, however, can be tricky due to the unique conditions and low-light environment. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide on how to best photograph the Northern Lights and come home with stunning images. 1. Choose the Right Time and Location: The Northern Lights are most visible in areas close to the magnetic poles, such as Norway, Iceland, Alaska, and parts of Canada. Timing is key ‚Äî the best chances for viewing occur during the winter months when the nights are longer and skies are clearer. It‚Äôs also important to check solar activity forecasts, as auroras are more intense during high solar activity. Pro Tip: Apps like My Aurora Forecast or websites like spaceweather. gov can help predict when the aurora will be active in your location. October 2024 thoughts:: The event currently scheduled for October 10th and 11th 2024 may be visible from as far south in the US as Alabama. Everyone in the country should be thinking about getting outside these evenings to see if they can find the Northern Lights. There is no guarantee that you‚Äôll see them, but you definitely won‚Äôt if you stay inside. 2. Essential Gear for Northern Lights Photography: You don‚Äôt need a fancy setup to capture the Northern Lights, but the right equipment will ensure your photos are sharp and detailed.  Camera: A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual settings is ideal.  Lens: Use a wide-angle lens (14-24mm) with a fast aperture (f/2. 8 or lower) to capture as much of the sky as possible.  Tripod: A sturdy tripod is a must. You‚Äôll be shooting long exposures, so keeping the camera still is crucial.  Remote Shutter or Timer: To avoid camera shake, use a remote shutter or set a delay timer. Pro Tip: Bring extra batteries ‚Äî cold weather can drain them quickly! 3. Set Up Your Camera: Understanding your camera‚Äôs settings is essential to photographing the Northern Lights. Since each aurora display varies in brightness and movement, experimenting with these settings will help you capture the perfect shot:  Aperture: Set your lens to its widest aperture (f/2. 8 or lower) to allow maximum light.  ISO: Start with an ISO of 800-1600. If the lights are faint, increase the ISO, but be careful not to introduce too much noise.  Shutter Speed: Adjust based on the intensity of the lights. A starting point is 5-15 seconds. If the aurora is moving fast, use shorter exposures (5-10 seconds) to avoid blurring the details.  Focus: Manually set your focus to infinity or focus on a distant light source, such as stars or a faraway mountain. Use live view mode to fine-tune the sharpness. Pro Tip: Take a few test shots and zoom in to ensure the stars are sharp. Autofocus often struggles in low light, so manual focus is usually best. 4. Framing and Composition: While the Northern Lights are the stars of the show, incorporating foreground elements like trees, mountains, or water can make your images more dynamic. The key is balance ‚Äî don‚Äôt let the foreground overpower the aurora, but use it to add depth and context to your shot.  Silhouettes: A tree line or cabin can add drama without distracting from the lights.  Reflections: If you‚Äôre near a body of water, try to capture the reflection of the lights in the water for an added layer of beauty.  Rule of Thirds: Use this composition rule to position the horizon on the lower third of the frame, giving the sky more space. Pro Tip: Use a headlamp with a red filter when setting up. Red light won‚Äôt impact your night vision as much as white light. 5. Post-Processing Tips: Once you‚Äôve captured your photos, post-processing can help bring out the beauty of the aurora.  Noise Reduction: Shooting at high ISOs can introduce noise, so use software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to reduce noise in your images.  Contrast and Exposure: Enhance the vibrancy and detail of the Northern Lights by adjusting the contrast, highlights, and shadows. Be careful not to over-edit and lose the natural look.  Sharpening: A bit of sharpening can bring out the stars and details in the aurora. 6. Patience and Perseverance: The Northern Lights are unpredictable. Sometimes they may appear for only a few minutes, while other times they could dance for hours. Be patient, keep shooting, and embrace the serenity of the experience. Often, the best shots come from waiting through long, cold nights for the perfect moment. Pro Tip: Always dress warmly and bring hot drinks or snacks to keep comfortable during long shooting sessions. Conclusion: Photographing the Northern Lights can be challenging but also immensely rewarding. With the right equipment, settings, and a bit of patience, you‚Äôll be able to capture stunning images of one of nature‚Äôs most magical displays. Remember to enjoy the moment, as seeing the aurora with your own eyes is an unforgettable experience ‚Äî the photos are just the icing on the cake! "

The race was held on August 17th, 2024 in Madison, Illinois. My first IndyCar experience was back in 2021 and this time hoped to improve on the shots I took during that race. I was fortunate enough to have access to the VIP suites building and planted myself on the top of the roof for the start of the race. From there I wandered down into the infield and spent the majority of the race along the fence in turn 3. Many of the turn 3 shots are fairly repetitive but I was over there trying to see what I could make the camera do and how the setting sun would effect things. Towards the end of the race I made my way back over near the front straight to see if I could get anywhere close to the finish for some shots but ended up not getting anything there worth posting, perhaps next time! Here in the gallery we have a handful of shots, check out the main gallery for 200 photos from the race! "

    "body": "2024/06/15 - One of the very first blog posts on this website, from back in 2019, was for the 2018 Big Foot Open House. Six years later I finally made it back out to the Big Foot Open House in Pacific Missouri and took more photos! I‚Äôm fond of High Roller II, so I went with the intention of taking some great pictures of the Krekeler‚Äôs Ford Ranger, but I managed to also get quite a few other trucks while I was out there this year. In addition to the 5 photos I have highlighted here on this blog post, you can find the full gallery of 154 pictures over here. As with most of our galleries, you can purchase I had a busy morning with central states hockey tryouts for my boy first thing, after dropping him off at home for a well earned day of rest, I headed south to Pacific. We spend quite a bit of time in Pacific with ice hockey and a couple of meetings with a client from work, but some of the most fun you can have in Pacific is visiting the Big Foot 4x4 Headquarters! I arrived sometime after 11am or so and parking was up to the Walgreens right on the main drag in town. I parked in the first grassy spot I could find and walked down to the open house event. Upon arrival I dropped off some prints I made for the owner of High Roller II, some of which I will hopefully upgrade with the recent photos taken today! Not long after I arrived Big Foot 15 headed out for a few car crush/jump passes around the fenced off field. I hadn‚Äôt really set myself up to get great shots for this first set of runs as the crown was 5 or 6 people deep from the fence when I did manage to walk around to the side of the field. Thankfully I‚Äôm tall enough that I was able to shoot over most of the people, and crop out the heads of those I didn‚Äôt on the shots of BF15. After they finished their run most of the crowd cleared out so I moved up to the fence line to make sure I had the angle on the old school car crush that I knew was going to happen soon. My persistance paid off with the shots you can see in the gallery of 154 shots from today. Did you attend the Big Foot Open House? What did you think of things this year? The only thing I could suggest, is maybe a water truck next year, put some dampness down on the field and cut down on some of the dust! Now let me go clean my camera off! Did you enjoy the old school car crush? Which was your favorite monster truck there this year? Was it the Ford of Big Foot 15? The two dodges, Blue Ox and The Blaine Crusher? What about the lone Chevy Waldo? Or maybe it was one of the Fords, Old Red Truck, Juggernaut Racing or High Roller II? "

I am fortunate enough to live close enough to the airport that I often see performers fly over my house when they arrive and when they are practicing on Thursday and Friday. This week was no different, after getting back from our trip to NYC super early on Thursday morning I was pleasantly notified by my wife around 10am on Thursday that jets were up and flying. I was able to step outside and see the Boeing F-15EX (or was it a QA?) flying over, close enough that I could snap a decent photo with my cell phone. I spent the afternoon Thursday running in and out of the house camera in hand trying to get photos of planes as they flew over while simultaneously trying to get work done throughout the day. Friday I was able to view quite a bit of the practice flights that occurred from up off of Wildhorse Creek road in Chesterfield. Saturday I spent the entire day in a spot at the air show just beyond the end of the runway at Spirit Airport to catch the performers in action. Over the past 4 days I took nearly thirteen thousand photos, I have spent a considerable amount of time culling down to a manageable list of photos that I thought could be published, you can find over 300 for your viewing pleasure in the online gallery with just a few of those featured in the gallery here on this blog post.

    "title": "April 8th 2024 Eclipse from Trail of Tears State Park in Jackson, Missouri",
    "body": "2024/04/15 - After experiencing the Total Eclipse passing over our home in Wildwood Missouri in 2017, we vowed as a family we would watch the next one together! For the 2017 event our oldest daughter was at school that day, maybe 1/2 mile away, but not with us. For the 2024 Eclipse we pulled both kids from school and hit the road just after 7am to head towards the path of totality. I was fearful of crazy traffic, but we left early enough that we avoided the morning chaos that would follow on I-55 southbound from St. Louis later in the morning. Finding a place to watch the eclipse: I spent a few evenings trying to determine where to watch the eclipse from. I had a couple of criteria when searching.  As much totality as possible: We were lucky that within a 2 hours drive south or east, we could find locations in the path of totality that had over 4 minutes of time.  Clear skies: Both for weather and line of sight to the sun. There are a lot of places in Missouri where the sun can be blocked by the trees, finding a clear line of sight was important. Sunday the 7th I spent a few hours pouring over potential locations and weather forecasts. I did something similar in 2017, waking up a few times early in the morning trying to scout out locations with the best chance of no cloud cover, ultimately based on forecasts, we stayed home, making the right choice. For 2024 this wasn‚Äôt going to be an option, our house wasn‚Äôt in the path of totality. Sunday evening I decided that Trail of Tears State Park outside of Jackson, MO would likely be our best choice, but I had a backup option of driving to a friend‚Äôs house in Illinois if something went wrong with the state park choice. Getting down to the state park was relatively uneventful, morning traffic in St. Louis wasn‚Äôt too bad, though it did start to back up just before Festus going south, for what I believe was construction. We ended up hopping off the highway and taking 61 for about 8 miles before getting back on I-55 south. Other folks who left an hour or two later had a nightmare of non-stop traffic all the way south on I-55. We ended up getting to the park just before 10am and were able to find what I would estimate to be one of the final 20 spots available at the time. We parked down near the boatramp, which was perfect for us because our son was excited about fishing for a while in the Mississippi river while waiting for the eclipse. Getting setup: We ended up deciding to watch the eclipse from right near our parked truck as opposed to finding a grassy spot to sit in. I wanted to keep our clear sky view and not have any trees blocking our view or any of the cameras I would be setting up. We packed lunch and snacks ahead of time, so beyond fishing and hitting the public restrooms we didn‚Äôt need to leave our spot for anything. Equipment: For the eclipse I would be shooting with 3 cameras, though only one really counted. I setup two GoPro cameras on tripods, one a Hero12 set to record video for the entirety of the eclipse. The other a Hero9 that I set on a timelapse, taking a photo every 5 seconds. My main rig for shooting the eclipse was my Canon R5. For a lens I had a 70-200m and a 2X extender attached. I attached a solar filter (same one I used in 2017) to the lens hood with rubberbands, this allowed me to quickly remove the filter during totality to get unprotected shots of the eclipse. The filter I used was an 8‚Äù Orion filter, though not as fancy as the ones currently on Amazon. All three cameras were mounted on their own tripod, though none of them with any star trackers, maybe in the future I‚Äôll have one of those fancy tools.  During the Eclipse: During the event I was running back and forth between my R5 and the family. Trying to get a variety of shots, but also trying to spend time with the family as well. I had my camera setup on shutter priority (TV), which means I was targetting adjustment of primarily the shutterspeed for the event. I shot a variety of speeds from 1/5 (of a second) up to 1/8000, though a majority of the shots and what worked were between 1/640 and 1/2500. For my ISO I shot at 100 pretty much the entire time. The biggest struggle I had during the eclipse was focusing. I tried setting auto-focus to on but for that to work you always have to be centered on the sun, and that‚Äôs very difficult to do when running on a tripod with a long lens/extender. You don‚Äôt realize how quickly the sun moves until you watch it though a zoom. So for focusing I manually focused, though the real struggle there was the solar filter. The way I had it mounted on the lens hood (without the hood extended) meant getting to the focus ring with my large hands was difficult. I ended up working with focus throughout the day, though I am not sure I was ever 100% happy with how I got it set, for the most part the photos worked out. See and Purchase The Results: Now for the important part, the actual results! You can find the photos I have processed and chosen to post here on the page, as well as in our high resolution gallery available here. Most of the shots I‚Äôve posted are during totality, though I have quite a few other stages. Bluntly, the other stages of the eclipse sort of get repetitive, while they make cool composition shots, I found them boring as individual shots so I didn‚Äôt post them for now. You‚Äôll find in the shots a couple of composites, where I merged together multiple photos to create something unique. All of these photos are available as prints, canvas and acrylics via our online gallery. If you‚Äôre interested in purchasing one of these photos in another format, please feel free to reach out. You need to experience a Total Eclipse!: Experiencing a Total Eclipse is a profound, almost mystical event. While a partial eclipse is certainly memorable, achieving totality transforms the experience entirely. It‚Äôs something you truly have to see for yourself to understand the full emotional and visual impact. People travel thousands of miles for just a few minutes of this celestial phenomenon, and once you‚Äôve witnessed it, you‚Äôll understand why. To get a taste of what I‚Äôm talking about, check out this captivating 7-minute, 4K video of the eclipse. Totality starts around 1:16, and you can hear the awe and excitement in the crowd‚Äôs reactions. It‚Äôs a preview of the exhilarating experience that awaits you.

    "title": "NASA PACE Falcon 9 Rocket Launch",
    "body": "2024/03/01 - In February of 2024, I had the pleasure of spending some time in Florida for a work conference. While there, I kept an eye on the forecast and space launch schedule to see if I might catch a rocket launch while in town. SpaceX was planning to launch a Falcon 9 with the NASA PACE payload. The launch ended up being delayed for 3 days, finally happening early in the morning on February 8th, 2024. This was not a publicly accessible launch, and I‚Äôm not sure why, but my assumption is that Falcon 9 launches are getting so frequent nowadays that late night/early morning launches are too much work from an organization perspective to try to allow the public access to the Cape to see launches. So, what does this mean? The public can still watch; they just have to do it from remote locations, not on the Cape.  Where did I watch the launch? I was fortunate enough to be invited to join a couple of remote family members who live and even work on the Cape, so I got special access. The morning started out with a quick tour of Mission Control, yes, Mission Control for the launch! There are actually two different rooms for MC, one for the active launch, and one for anything else going on or tours, so we got to walk through the empty mission control room and look into the active room. With Falcon 9 launches, the number of people in mission control is pretty minimal, which was surprising to see considering what was occurring.  What was the best part about the Mission Control tour? The laugh I got in the bathroom! Check out this sign. If the people who are launching rockets into space can‚Äôt even hit the toilet, how are they going to land on Mars? (sorry, I couldn‚Äôt resist) Then came the launch itself. I won‚Äôt share exact details on where we were for the launch, but boy was that an experience! This Falcon 9 rocket was launching towards the south, something that a NASA payload hadn‚Äôt done in 50+ years, the last time on November 30th, 1960, having a problem during launch and rumored to kill a cow in Cuba. After the launch, and I mean, almost right after, like 7 minutes, the rocket would come back and land also on the Cape. We were set up to watch the launch, knowing that we didn‚Äôt have the best spot to view the landing pad, but had thoughts of maybe trying to drive over to catch the landing. Long story short, we didn‚Äôt make it over to see the landing, we took too long watching the launch and nearly missed the landing altogether as we were driving west towards it when the sky lit up with what looked like lightning then the sun as the rocket reignited for landing along with sonic booms as it broke the sound barrier. I managed to stick the camera out the window of the SUV and got a shot or two, but nothing great of the landing. It was a great experience, it had been 14 years since I saw my first shuttle launch, also a night launch with access to the Cape from an employee. This launch had a little less excitement as the Shuttle launch we had to rush to get on the bus to depart our viewing location because of the risk of an acid cloud blowing back at us! I can‚Äôt wait for my next launch, and definitely am taking my family with me next time so they can experience it too! "

    "title": "Bald Eagles in Clarksville, Missouri January 2024",
    "body": "2024/01/25 - On Sunday morning, the 21st of January, I headed up to Clarksville Missouri to look for Bald Eagles along the Mississippi River. I arrived just after sunrise (next time I‚Äôll leave earlier) and immediately saw two Bald Eagles flying just north of the lock and dam. I knew it was going to be a good day. I parked in the public parking near the lock and dam and immediately started getting my equipment ready to get setup. I took a monopod, instead of a tripod for the day, though I am not sure if that was the best choice. Other photographers who were there had tripods, while I had a little more mobility than they did, I feel like I could have used the stability of a tripod. I‚Äôll have to try that next time. It was a rather cold morning, and while I thought I was prepared for the chill, I wasn‚Äôt. Next time I‚Äôll go I‚Äôll be sure to take a mask and better gloves with me. The Eagles south of the damn were pretty active just after sunrise, with bursts of activity as they were trying to find fish in the river. After an hour or so in Clarksville, I headed south on 79. I ended up driving through Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge. I also stopped for a bit in Winfield, Missouri and found a few more Bald Eagles hunting there. Here in the gallery you can see a couple of the shots I was able to capture, I look forward to going back again soon. I‚Äôve posted a 36 megabyte image that has 99 shots of one particular Bald Eagle going through the motions of catching and flying off with a fish.

The game was set into motion with St. Peters taking an early lead, ending the first period 4-2. Despite the initial advantage, Chesterfield‚Äôs standout player, Suda, demonstrated his skill, accounting for all three of the team‚Äôs initial goals, including one in the second period. This brought the score to 5-3 in favor of St. Peters as they headed into the final period. As the third period wound down, tension reached its peak. Chesterfield, showing their never-say-die spirit, managed to pull the score within one, trailing 6-5. In a tactical move, Chesterfield decided to pull their goalie, allowing an extra skater onto the ice. This strategy is commonly used to increase offensive pressure in hopes of equalizing the score. However, due to an oversight by the referees who mistakenly believed Chesterfield had too many players on the ice, a potential game-tying scoring opportunity was thwarted. This error in judgment shifted the momentum, hindering Chesterfield‚Äôs chances of leveling the game. Despite their best efforts, the Chesterfield Falcons were unable to recapture their momentum, culminating in a hard-fought 6-5 victory for St. Peters Hockey. Both teams displayed tremendous heart and skill, making it a memorable game for all in attendance.

    "body": "2023/08/17 - PhotoMark. co has gone into hybernation as of 9/30/2023. It may be revived again in the future. : A few weeks before the 2023 MR340 I posted in the Facebook group asking if people wanted the MR340 logo overlaid on the photos from the event. The response was mixed, probably around 50/50, with some people wanting it, and others preferring not to have it. I err‚Äôd on the side of not including the logo on the photos that were made available for purchase from the event, but had every intention of figuring out a way to allow the people who wanted the logo, to add the logo, post purchase. Well, I am proud to announce I‚Äôve come up with a way for you to do that! Introducing PHOTOMARK. CO, a simple way for you to add the MR340 logo to your photos from the event. The basics are:  Visit the website.  Upload your photo.  Choose your Logo option (black and gray).  Download the newly generated photo!It‚Äôs that simple! Though you will need to do this one at a time for each photo you want to add the logo to. If you haven‚Äôt purchased any MR340 photos yet, you can do so here. Currently the website is pretty simple, allowing you to choose only from the 2023 MR340 logo options, in the future I might make it a little more customizable to support future, and past, events! This is 100% brand new, custom code, so if you run into any problems, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out with feedback! "

    "body": "2023/08/04 - The 2023 Missouri River Relief MR340 Event Photos are now available! What a week, what should have been 5 solid days of shooting turned into 2. 5 as the weather ended the Missouri River 340 river race on Wednesday afternoon. I made it home that evening and began processing the 10k+ photos I took for the event. This was my first time with the MR340, and I had a blast! Like other events I have participated in, and shot, the MR340 is a family. Everyone is there to help each other out, and have a good time. I was cautious about shooting this event, as I was not sure how the racers would react to me coming in and trying to fill the gap of their previous photographer who was unable to shoot this year. I was pleasantly surprised to find that everyone was very friendly, and happy to see me out there. I did my best to get a photo of every boat that I could, and tried to get multiple. I most likely missed a few, for that I apologize! The photos are organized into folders and galleries based on Locations (Check In Day, Start, Napoleon, Waverly, Glasgow, Boonville, Hermann, New Haven, Finish Line Party) and then depending on how many photos I took at a location, also organized into galleries based on windows of time. If you don‚Äôt know exactly when you passed through a check point/paddle stop, look at RaceOwl for your splits, then you can check the gallery for that location/time and find the photos of your boat, it is possible you‚Äôll find photos in two time slots depending on how your splits worked out. View the 2023 MR340 Photos! I haven‚Äôt yet committed to being there again next year, it really depends on if I can justify taking a week off of my day job and ‚Äúworking‚Äù the event with my photography business! This year was a test, see if I could do it in a way that made financial sense to do so, I haven‚Äôt figured out if that‚Äôs the case or not yet, but hopefully you all enjoy the photos I took, and specifically enjoy them enough to order some digital downloads or prints! Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me with any feedback you might have, I always love hearing from you all! Thank you again for being so welcoming this week and making me feel at home. -Chris Hammond, Wildwood, MO "

In August 2017 the  total eclipse passed right over our city with some of the longest times available in the country. This week we're  fortunate enough to be able to see the Comet Neowise that was discovered back in March and recently travelled near  the Sun and became (somewhat) visible to the naked eye due to that pass. Over the past three evenings I've been out trying to get photos of the comet, and have had some decent luck doing so.   I figured I would post some information on how I was able to do this to try to assist anyone who might be interested  in trying to spot the comet, and maybe even take a photo. Tools:   You  Binoculars  iPhone  Night Sky App  Camera  Tripod  Long LensTL;DR: If you really want to cut to the chase, here are the quick tips to finding and shooting the comet.   Try to find a dark sky (https://www. darksitefinder. com/) but you    can likely do it from anywhere you can see the northwest sky/horizon.   Download Night Sky app in iOS and look for the comet there, point your phone in that direction  Setup your camera on a tripod, point your camera in the direction of the comet based on the app.   Use the fastest lens you have, what is fast, whatever lets the most light in F1. 4 is better than F2. 8 which is    better than F4. 0  Switch to Manual mode on your camera  If your camera will show you, check the exposure before you shoot, try to make sure the shot will not be way    under exposed, or over exposed. Adjust the shutter duration to go up or down on exposure.

When to see the Neowise Comet?: So the first thing you need to do is to figure out when/where to look for the comet. It isn't quite known how long  the comet will be visible, so I recommend taking the opportunity to find it as soon as you can. If you find it one  night, you can always try again the next night too! If you don't find it the first night, try again the next. Weather is going to matter in finding the comet, cloud cover will hinder your efforts for finding it, so pay  attention to the forecast for the next couple of weeks to try to find an evening/night that is going to be clear. When to see the Neowise Comet?: With the sun setting around 830pm the past few evenings, I was able to find the comet (in photos) at 9:24pm on the  12th, 9:21pm on the 13th and 9:07pm on the 14th. That's not to say you can't find it earlier than that, I just  struggled finding it until the darkness really started to set in and stars started to appear in the sky. Where to see the Neowise Comet?: The first two nights I went out into St. Charles County to the Weldon Spring Site, a superfund site that has a park  and mound that you can walk up on top of. The mound technically is not open to the public after dark, I tried not to  stay too long after sunset‚Ä¶ The mound offers a great view of St. Charles county, with no obstruction of the skyline  for miles and miles in any direction. The third night I used my front yard and had to work around quite a few trees  in the area, limiting my ability to see the comet for as long as I could on the mound. For the central United States (I'm writing this from just outside of St. Louis, Missouri) you're going to look to the  north west sky after the sun sets. You're going to want to find the Big Dipper, if you're looking around 9pm or just  after it will be ‚Äúpointing down‚Äù meaning the largest portion of the pot/ladle will be somewhat parallel to the  ground. Between the bottom of the big dipper and the ground is where you will find the comet. If you're using an iPhone, try downloading the Night Sky app. I have found that to be useful in trying to track  things down, though not 100% accurate as to the ‚Äúheight‚Äù of the comet, it at least gets you looking in the right  direction. Finding the comet: Once you are looking in the right direction, you need to actually find the comet, this is the hard part. The first  night I was out, we couldn't spot it. I didn't even realize I got a photo of it until I got home and looked at the  photos on a computer the next morning. Once I spotted it though, I knew I had been looking in the wrong place. The  Night Sky app made me think it would be right on the horizon the whole evening and it was much higher and to the  right than I expected. So, tips on finding the comet.   Go dark, find as dark a place as you can. Try to avoid looking at your phone too much. Try to avoid looking at    lights. Get your eyes adjusted, used to the dark, so that stars start popping out.   Use a camera, try to find it in a photo (see some camera tips below). If you can find it with a longer exposure    camera shot, that will likely help you try to locate it in the sky. I find looking through a view finder with a    zoom lens to be easier than trying to use a ‚Äúlive view‚Äù digital display on a camera.   Use binoculars. They don't even have to be high dollar binoculars, my 7 year old son found it with a plastic    pair of binoculars he probably got when he was 2 years old. The added magnification definitely helps. So what are you looking for? You're looking for a star really, that's what it looks like, it is not a bright star, it  is rather faint, but if you can find it, and focus on it, you might be able to start to see the ‚Äútail‚Äù. Here is a  photo that if you look closely you might be able to see the comet. At the bottom of the photo, look at the power  pole (the black pole) and follow that directly up towards the top third of the photo. You'll see a very very faint  spec, that's the comet. (click the photo to view a larger version)   The tail of the comet starts out pointing towards 2 o'clock or so on a clock. Here's a zoomed in view of the same  photo above, notice you can't really see the tail yet, though I've attempted to draw in where it should be   So once you find the comet, you're going to need to keep track of it. It isn't ‚Äúmoving across the sky‚Äù like a  shooting star, but it will rotate with the night sky (as the earth turns). That first photo was taken at 9:07pm  central time, here is one taken at 9:53 pm central time. This photo is zoomed in (300mm) but the tree you're seeing  is the one in the bottom right of the original photo, so you can see just how much the comet moved across the sky in  46 minutes. '   You're going to lose the comet at some point throughout the night, if you haven't lost it behind an object, you may  just need to reset yourself and locate it similar to how you first find/found it mentioned above. Photographing the Neowise Comet: What about taking photos of the comet? There's art and magic to that, and I definitely don't claim to be an expert in  the practice, but here is what I've found. Taking photos at night requires a combination of settings, tools, patience and practice. If you have a camera with  swappable lenses, you will want something with a good aperture. Equipment I used:   Camera: Canon 5D Mark II (purchased in 2009)  Tripod: ProMaster Specialist SP425CK Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit  Lenses:       Canon 24-105mm F4      Sigma 120-300mm F2. 8        Wired Remote Shutter ReleaseThe first night I shot with a 24-105mm F4 Canon lens on my Canon 5D Mark II. This lens is F4, which is okay for  during the day, but not great at night, you want a lower aperture, like F2. 8 if you can. At 105mm F4, shooting  ISO400 I took a 1. 6 second exposure to get this shot, the first one I can find the comet in.    The problem with longer exposures is movement, of the stars, and of your equipment. You can see the lights in the  bottom of this photo aren't super focused. This second photo was taken that same night at 9:41pm, 105mm F4 ISO 3200  with a 2 second exposure.    With both of those photos I didn't actually know I had the comet until the next morning when viewing/editing the  photos on my desktop. After finding the comet in the photos I decided that I needed to pick up a better lens (better  aperture) and try again, so I went down to the local camera store here in St. Louis before they closed on Monday  evening and rented a Sigma 120mm-300mm F2. 8 lens. This is a SUPER nice lens, but also pricey, with a deposit of  around $3500 just to rent it. It also is rather heavy, so be sure you've got a nice sturdy tripod. Monday night I went back out to the mound with the new lens and got there just as the sun finish setting. I knew I  wouldn't find the comet super early after sunset, so I wasn't in a rush to try to get setup. At 9:21pm I was able to  locate the comet in a photo on the display of my camera (zooming in to the photo view after) and thus knew where I  was going to be aiming/shooting the rest of the night. A good friend of mine was with me and he educated me on  Mirror lock. Which in a DSLR basically means the camera will move the mirror, and lock it in place, then requiring  you to press the button again to open the shutter. This allows you to move the mirror, let the camera stabilize, and  then open the shutter. Otherwise the mirror moves and the shutter opens in a quick motion, which can cause jiggle in  the camera. With Mirror Lock you just have to make shooting a two step process, one button press to move the mirror,  one to open the shutter. Here is one of the shots taken at 9:22pm 120mm ISO 400 F2. 8 with a . 8 second exposure.    This is a shot zoomed in at 300mm ISO 1250 F2. 8 with a 1. 3 second exposure, taken at 9:36pm central.    Tips for shooting the comet: Practice! Focusing on the comet will be hard, nearly impossible by hand with a 5dMarkII, so I would recommend that  you find another bright star and focus on that, then turn off your autofocus. You don't want the focus to be off,  otherwise you might miss the opportunity of a lifetime when a plane passes through the picture, and you find out  afterwards that your focus was off.    I focused primarily on Jupiter, which was opposite the comet and was one of the brightest objects in the sky. Here's  a photo of the planet and some of it's moons. No the best photo, but I thought it was cool that the moons showed up.   300mm ISO 6400 F2. 8 and 1 second exposure.    The key to doing this is simply practice, get out and shoot as much as you can. Try lots of settings, change your  ISO, see how much noise your photos get as you go higher in ISO, some newer cameras are much better at high ISO,  which allows you to lower your shutter exposure time to get faster shots. Play with your exposure times, increase  them, decrease them, see what works out best for your camera. I played with 30 second exposures and you get a lot of  movement of the starts and comet with a 30 second exposure, which creates a not good photo, so I didn't bother  processing any of those. Most importantly, just get out and see it. Have fun, enjoy this world we live in, the comet is one of the ‚Äúbright‚Äù  spots of 2020. Here is a slideshow of the various photos I've posted from the comet so far.    And one final animation of the comet moving out of my view on July 14th.  "
