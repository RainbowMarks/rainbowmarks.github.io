        <title>Bald Eagles in Clarksville, Missouri January 2024</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning, the 21st of January, I headed up to Clarksville Missouri to look for Bald Eagles along the Mississippi River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived just after sunrise (next time I’ll leave earlier) and immediately saw two Bald Eagles flying just north of the lock and dam. I knew it was going to be a good day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I parked in the public parking near the lock and dam and immediately started getting my equipment ready to get setup. I took a monopod, instead of a tripod for the day, though I am not sure if that was the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other photographers who were there had tripods, while I had a little more mobility than they did, I feel like I could have used the stability of a tripod. I’ll have to try that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a rather cold morning, and while I thought I was prepared for the chill, I wasn’t. Next time I’ll go I’ll be sure to take a mask and better gloves with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eagles south of the damn were pretty active just after sunrise, with bursts of activity as they were trying to find fish in the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so in Clarksville, I headed south on 79. I ended up driving through Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge. I also stopped for a bit in Winfield, Missouri and found a few more Bald Eagles hunting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the gallery you can see a couple of the shots I was able to capture, I look forward to going back again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve posted a 36 megabyte image that has 99 shots of one particular Bald Eagle going through the motions of catching and flying off with a fish. You can see the full high resolution photo here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rainbowmarks.com/img/Birds2024-2.jpg&quot;&gt;Bald Eagle Catching Fish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Chesterfield Falcons had two games the weekend of January 20th, 2024. The AI generated game summaries are below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-summary-chesterfield-falcons-10ua1-vs-kirkwood-stars-10ua1&quot;&gt;Game Summary: Chesterfield Falcons 10UA1 vs Kirkwood Stars 10UA1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;date-saturday-january-20th-2024&quot;&gt;Date: Saturday January 20th, 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an exhilarating display of youth ice hockey, the Chesterfield Falcons 10UA1 faced off against the Kirkwood Stars 10UA1 at the Maryville University Hockey Center on the Shanahan rink. The matchup was highly anticipated, especially considering the history of the two teams. In their previous encounters, the Kirkwood Stars had dominated, winning 10-2 and 7-0. However, this game proved to be a stark contrast to their past meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the drop of the puck, it was evident that the Falcons had come with a new level of determination and skill. Both teams exhibited remarkable talent and teamwork, making it a thrilling game to watch. The Falcons, showing significant improvement from their previous games, matched the Stars play for play, leading to a nail-bitingly close contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game, the lead oscillated between the two teams, with each side scoring impressive goals. The young athletes on the ice demonstrated not only skill but also sportsmanship and a passion for the game, which was infectious for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the final buzzer sounded, the scoreboard read 6-6, marking the end of regulation time in a draw. This result was a testament to the hard work and improvement of the Chesterfield Falcons, who managed to hold their own against a team that had previously bested them with significant margins. For the Kirkwood Stars, it was a reminder of the unpredictability and competitive spirit inherent in sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this game was not just a display of young talent, but also a story of resilience, improvement, and the unyielding spirit of competition. Both the Chesterfield Falcons and the Kirkwood Stars should be proud of their performance in a game that will surely be remembered for its intensity and the remarkable skill displayed by all players involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-summary-chesterfield-falcons-10ua1-vs-affton-all-americans-10ua1&quot;&gt;Game Summary: Chesterfield Falcons 10UA1 vs Affton All-Americans 10UA1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;date-sunday-january-21st-2024&quot;&gt;Date: Sunday January 21st, 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chesterfield Falcons 10UA1 continued their impressive run in youth ice hockey with a solid victory over the Affton All-Americans 10UA1, finishing with a score of 4-1. This game, held at the same rink where they had tied the day before with another team, showcased the Falcons’ resilience and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affton All-Americans started the game on a high note, with Chase Cotton opening the scoring with 6:55 left in the first period. This early lead set the stage for an intense game, but the Falcons quickly responded. Demonstrating their competitive spirit and ability to handle pressure, Chesterfield’s defenseman Matthew Pitcher tied the game just 1:10 later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Falcons’ momentum continued to build as Bennett Suda attempted to dump the puck in front of the goal, leading to an unexpected but welcome goal, putting Chesterfield in the lead. The first period ended with the Falcons leading 2-1, a testament to their quick recovery and offensive prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second period, the Falcons maintained their dominance. Levi James extended their lead with a goal with 5:59 remaining, showcasing the depth of talent in the Chesterfield team. The Falcons’ defense and goaltender also deserve commendation for their performance in keeping the All-Americans at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third period saw Chesterfield solidifying their lead. Bennett Suda, assisted by Lucky Huntebrinker, scored with 6:54 remaining, bringing the score to 4-1. This goal underscored the Falcons’ strategic play and effective teamwork throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final whistle confirmed Chesterfield’s victory, with a repeat scoreline of 4-1 against the Affton All-Americans, similar to their previous encounter. This win further established the Falcons as a formidable team in the league, capable of maintaining consistency and showcasing improvement game after game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Affton All-Americans, despite the loss, the team’s early goal and overall performance highlighted their potential and the competitive nature of the league. Both teams exhibited commendable skill and sportsmanship, making it an enjoyable game for spectators and a valuable experience for the young athletes involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chesterfield Falcons 10U-A1 Shine at the Leprechaun Lashout Tournament</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Chesterfield Falcons 10U-A1 team showcased their talent and determination at the prestigious Leprechaun Lashout tournament held at the iconic Notre Dame University. Here’s a recap of their journey game by game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-1-chesterfield-falcons-vs-chicago-flames&quot;&gt;Game 1: Chesterfield Falcons vs. Chicago Flames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tournament’s opening game held at the Ice Box, the Falcons asserted their dominance early on. &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Hammond&lt;/strong&gt; spearheaded the charge with the opening goal, setting the tone for the rest of the game. Although the official scoreboard showcased an impressive 8-0 win, sources say the Falcons had notched up at least 12 goals! &lt;strong&gt;Braxton Vatterott&lt;/strong&gt; was particularly scintillating, with a hattrick under his belt. Adding another feather to their cap, &lt;strong&gt;Miles McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt; recorded his first shutout of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-2-chesterfield-falcons-vs-joliet-jaguars&quot;&gt;Game 2: Chesterfield Falcons vs. Joliet Jaguars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning’s clash with the Joliet Jaguars Squirt 1 team on the “Lefty Smith” rink proved to be a challenging one for the Falcons. The Jaguars’ strategy of utilizing breakaways put them in the driver’s seat, ultimately clinching a 7-3 victory. Despite the loss, the Falcons learned valuable lessons in teamwork and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-3-chesterfield-falcons-vs-fox-motors-hockey-club&quot;&gt;Game 3: Chesterfield Falcons vs. Fox Motors Hockey Club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouncing back from the morning’s setback, the Falcons were in splendid form against the Fox Motors Hockey Club on Notre Dame’s Olympic rink. Securing a comfortable 5-2 victory, the win was a testament to the team’s fighting spirit. Although they conceded two late goals, the Falcons’ performance ensured their place in the championship showdown. The victory was made even sweeter with a memorable team photo session at the Compton Family Ice Arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;championship-game-chesterfield-falcons-vs-joliet-jaguars&quot;&gt;Championship Game: Chesterfield Falcons vs. Joliet Jaguars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning brought with it the promise of redemption as the Falcons once again faced the Jaguars. Although the Jaguars took the early lead, it was &lt;strong&gt;Daniel “Hammer” Hammond&lt;/strong&gt; who dazzled with his finesse, tying the game with a remarkable goal. The momentum swung in the Falcons’ favor when &lt;strong&gt;Bennett Suda&lt;/strong&gt; found the net, giving them a lead they wouldn’t relinquish. &lt;strong&gt;Jasper Boyher&lt;/strong&gt; put the cherry on top with a late empty-netter, ensuring the Falcons clinched the Squirt AA title of the Leprechaun Lashout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Leprechaun Lashout tournament was a testament to the Chesterfield Falcons 10U-A1 team’s skill, determination, and heart. They fought, they learned, and they emerged victorious. Kudos to every player, coach, and supporter for this remarkable achievement!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>St. Peters Youth Ice Hockey Photos - 10U-A1 10-7-2023</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-summary-st-peters-hockey-vs-chesterfield-falcons-10u-a1-squirt-hockey-match&quot;&gt;Game Summary: St. Peters Hockey vs Chesterfield Falcons (10U A1 Squirt Hockey Match)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2023/Hockey/23-24-Falcons-10U-A1/10-7-2023-vs-St-Peters&quot;&gt;View the full gallery with 170+ photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an electrifying matchup between St. Peters Hockey and Chesterfield Falcons, fans were treated to a display of talent, grit, and determination from both squads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game was set into motion with St. Peters taking an early lead, ending the first period 4-2. Despite the initial advantage, Chesterfield’s standout player, Suda, demonstrated his skill, accounting for all three of the team’s initial goals, including one in the second period. This brought the score to 5-3 in favor of St. Peters as they headed into the final period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the third period wound down, tension reached its peak. Chesterfield, showing their never-say-die spirit, managed to pull the score within one, trailing 6-5. In a tactical move, Chesterfield decided to pull their goalie, allowing an extra skater onto the ice. This strategy is commonly used to increase offensive pressure in hopes of equalizing the score. However, due to an oversight by the referees who mistakenly believed Chesterfield had too many players on the ice, a potential game-tying scoring opportunity was thwarted. This error in judgment shifted the momentum, hindering Chesterfield’s chances of leveling the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their best efforts, the Chesterfield Falcons were unable to recapture their momentum, culminating in a hard-fought 6-5 victory for St. Peters Hockey. Both teams displayed tremendous heart and skill, making it a memorable game for all in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
