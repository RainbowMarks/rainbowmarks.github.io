        <title>How to Photograph the Northern Lights: A Guide to Capturing Nature‚Äôs Spectacular Light Show</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent influx of solar activity the ability for more parts of the United States to see the Northern Lights (aurora borealis) has increased many times over the past year. We are in a peak phase of sun activity this year and may continue to have opportunities for the near future, but you never know, so if you‚Äôve got an opportunity to get outside, do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are one of the most breathtaking natural phenomena to witness. Capturing them through photography, however, can be tricky due to the unique conditions and low-light environment. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide on how to best photograph the Northern Lights and come home with stunning images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-choose-the-right-time-and-location&quot;&gt;1. Choose the Right Time and Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lights are most visible in areas close to the magnetic poles, such as Norway, Iceland, Alaska, and parts of Canada. Timing is key ‚Äî the best chances for viewing occur during the winter months when the nights are longer and skies are clearer. It‚Äôs also important to check solar activity forecasts, as auroras are more intense during high solar activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Apps like My Aurora Forecast or websites like spaceweather.gov can help predict when the aurora will be active in your location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;october-2024-thoughts&quot;&gt;October 2024 thoughts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event currently scheduled for October 10th and 11th 2024 may be visible from as far south in the US as Alabama. Everyone in the country should be thinking about getting outside these evenings to see if they can find the Northern Lights. There is no guarantee that you‚Äôll see them, but you definitely won‚Äôt if you stay inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-essential-gear-for-northern-lights-photography&quot;&gt;2. Essential Gear for Northern Lights Photography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt need a fancy setup to capture the Northern Lights, but the right equipment will ensure your photos are sharp and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera:&lt;/strong&gt; A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual settings is ideal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lens:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a wide-angle lens (14-24mm) with a fast aperture (f/2.8 or lower) to capture as much of the sky as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tripod:&lt;/strong&gt; A sturdy tripod is a must. You‚Äôll be shooting long exposures, so keeping the camera still is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Shutter or Timer:&lt;/strong&gt; To avoid camera shake, use a remote shutter or set a delay timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Bring extra batteries ‚Äî cold weather can drain them quickly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-set-up-your-camera&quot;&gt;3. Set Up Your Camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding your camera‚Äôs settings is essential to photographing the Northern Lights. Since each aurora display varies in brightness and movement, experimenting with these settings will help you capture the perfect shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aperture:&lt;/strong&gt; Set your lens to its widest aperture (f/2.8 or lower) to allow maximum light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISO:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with an ISO of 800-1600. If the lights are faint, increase the ISO, but be careful not to introduce too much noise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shutter Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Adjust based on the intensity of the lights. A starting point is 5-15 seconds. If the aurora is moving fast, use shorter exposures (5-10 seconds) to avoid blurring the details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Manually set your focus to infinity or focus on a distant light source, such as stars or a faraway mountain. Use live view mode to fine-tune the sharpness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Take a few test shots and zoom in to ensure the stars are sharp. Autofocus often struggles in low light, so manual focus is usually best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-framing-and-composition&quot;&gt;4. Framing and Composition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Northern Lights are the stars of the show, incorporating foreground elements like trees, mountains, or water can make your images more dynamic. The key is balance ‚Äî don‚Äôt let the foreground overpower the aurora, but use it to add depth and context to your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silhouettes:&lt;/strong&gt; A tree line or cabin can add drama without distracting from the lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflections:&lt;/strong&gt; If you‚Äôre near a body of water, try to capture the reflection of the lights in the water for an added layer of beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Thirds:&lt;/strong&gt; Use this composition rule to position the horizon on the lower third of the frame, giving the sky more space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a headlamp with a red filter when setting up. Red light won‚Äôt impact your night vision as much as white light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-post-processing-tips&quot;&gt;5. Post-Processing Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve captured your photos, post-processing can help bring out the beauty of the aurora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Shooting at high ISOs can introduce noise, so use software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to reduce noise in your images.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast and Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhance the vibrancy and detail of the Northern Lights by adjusting the contrast, highlights, and shadows. Be careful not to over-edit and lose the natural look.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharpening:&lt;/strong&gt; A bit of sharpening can bring out the stars and details in the aurora.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-patience-and-perseverance&quot;&gt;6. Patience and Perseverance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lights are unpredictable. Sometimes they may appear for only a few minutes, while other times they could dance for hours. Be patient, keep shooting, and embrace the serenity of the experience. Often, the best shots come from waiting through long, cold nights for the perfect moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Always dress warmly and bring hot drinks or snacks to keep comfortable during long shooting sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographing the Northern Lights can be challenging but also immensely rewarding. With the right equipment, settings, and a bit of patience, you‚Äôll be able to capture stunning images of one of nature‚Äôs most magical displays. Remember to enjoy the moment, as seeing the aurora with your own eyes is an unforgettable experience ‚Äî the photos are just the icing on the cake!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Bommarito 500 IndyCar Photos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of once again getting to wander around World Wide Technology Raceway for the IndyCar event this weekend, the Bommarito 500! The race was held on August 17th, 2024 in Madison, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rainbowmarks.com/Events/2021/08/August-21-2021-IndyCar-Race-At-WWT-Raceway&quot;&gt;My first IndyCar experience was back in 2021&lt;/a&gt; and this time hoped to improve on the shots I took during that race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to have access to the VIP suites building and planted myself on the top of the roof for the start of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I wandered down into the infield and spent the majority of the race along the fence in turn 3. Many of the turn 3 shots are fairly repetitive but I was over there trying to see what I could make the camera do and how the setting sun would effect things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the race I made my way back over near the front straight to see if I could get anywhere close to the finish for some shots but ended up not getting anything there worth posting, perhaps next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the gallery we have a handful of shots, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Bommarito-500&quot;&gt;check out the main gallery for 200 photos from the race&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Miner Tough Weekend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Year four! of shooting the Miner Tough weekend down in St. Joe State Park here in Missouri kicked off with Trail Run on Saturday July 13th, 2024, followed by the Mountain Bike Race on Sunday July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year, the event chose to have our photo services available for everyone to have access to free photo downloads! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend&quot;&gt;find the photos from the Miner Tough Weekend events now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll find three different galleries, I tried to get a photo of every entrant but likely missed a few:&lt;/p&gt;

If you happened to pass at the right time to get in the frame and the photo wasn‚Äôt the blurriest thing ever created you might find yourself in these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like you can order prints from our online galleries.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Big Foot Open House</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the very first blog posts on this website, from back in 2019, was for the &lt;a href=&quot;/Events/2019/09/Big-Foot-Open-House&quot;&gt;2018 Big Foot Open House&lt;/a&gt;. Six years later I finally made it back out to the Big Foot Open House in Pacific Missouri and took more photos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm fond of High Roller II, so I went with the intention of taking some great pictures of the Krekeler‚Äôs Ford Ranger, but I managed to also get quite a few other trucks while I was out there this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 5 photos I have highlighted here on this blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/2024-Big-Foot-Open-House&quot;&gt;you can find the full gallery of 154 pictures over here&lt;/a&gt;. As with most of our galleries, you can purchase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a busy morning with central states hockey tryouts for my boy first thing, after dropping him off at home for a well earned day of rest, I headed south to Pacific. We spend quite a bit of time in Pacific with ice hockey and a couple of meetings with a client from work, but some of the most fun you can have in Pacific is visiting the Big Foot 4x4 Headquarters! I arrived sometime after 11am or so and parking was up to the Walgreens right on the main drag in town. I parked in the first grassy spot I could find and walked down to the open house event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival I dropped off some prints I made for the owner of High Roller II, some of which I will hopefully upgrade with the recent photos taken today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after I arrived Big Foot 15 headed out for a few car crush/jump passes around the fenced off field. I hadn‚Äôt really set myself up to get great shots for this first set of runs as the crown was 5 or 6 people deep from the fence when I did manage to walk around to the side of the field. Thankfully I‚Äôm tall enough that I was able to shoot over most of the people, and crop out the heads of those I didn‚Äôt on the shots of BF15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they finished their run most of the crowd cleared out so I moved up to the fence line to make sure I had the angle on the old school car crush that I knew was going to happen soon. My persistance paid off with the shots you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/2024-Big-Foot-Open-House&quot;&gt;in the gallery of 154 shots from today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you attend the Big Foot Open House? What did you think of things this year? The only thing I could suggest, is maybe a water truck next year, put some dampness down on the field and cut down on some of the dust! Now let me go clean my camera off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you enjoy the old school car crush?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was your favorite monster truck there this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it the Ford of Big Foot 15? The two dodges, Blue Ox and The Blaine Crusher? What about the lone Chevy Waldo? Or maybe it was one of the Fords,  Old Red Truck, Juggernaut Racing or High Roller II?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spirit of St. Louis Air Show &amp; STEM Expo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm an Air Force brat, that means I love air shows, so when the Spirit of St. Louis Air Show &amp;amp; STEM Expo come to town every 2 years I am in heaven for the week. I am fortunate enough to live close enough to the airport that I often see performers fly over my house when they arrive and when they are practicing on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was no different, after getting back from our trip to NYC super early on Thursday morning I was pleasantly notified by my wife around 10am on Thursday that jets were up and flying. I was able to step outside and see the Boeing F-15EX (or was it a QA?) flying over, close enough that I could snap a decent photo with my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the afternoon Thursday running in and out of the house camera in hand trying to get photos of planes as they flew over while simultaneously trying to get work done throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I was able to view quite a bit of the practice flights that occurred from up off of Wildhorse Creek road in Chesterfield. Saturday I spent the entire day in a spot at the air show just beyond the end of the runway at Spirit Airport to catch the performers in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 4 days I took nearly thirteen thousand photos, I have spent a considerable amount of time culling down to a manageable list of photos that I thought could be published, you can find over 300 for your viewing pleasure in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Spirit-Of-St-Louis-Air-Show-Stem-Expo&quot;&gt;online gallery&lt;/a&gt; with just a few of those featured in the gallery here on this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we work on some special print discounts from the Air Show later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>April 8th 2024 Eclipse from Trail of Tears State Park in Jackson, Missouri</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After experiencing the Total Eclipse passing over our home in Wildwood Missouri in 2017, we vowed as a family we would watch the next one together! For the 2017 event our oldest daughter was at school that day, maybe 1/2 mile away, but not with us. For the 2024 Eclipse we pulled both kids from school and hit the road just after 7am to head towards the path of totality. I was fearful of crazy traffic, but we left early enough that we avoided the morning chaos that would follow on I-55 southbound from St. Louis later in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-a-place-to-watch-the-eclipse&quot;&gt;Finding a place to watch the eclipse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a few evenings trying to determine where to watch the eclipse from. I had a couple of criteria when searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As much totality as possible: We were lucky that within a 2 hours drive south or east, we could find locations in the path of totality that had over 4 minutes of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear skies: Both for weather and line of sight to the sun. There are a lot of places in Missouri where the sun can be blocked by the trees, finding a clear line of sight was important.
Sunday the 7th I spent a few hours pouring over potential locations and weather forecasts. I did something similar in 2017, waking up a few times early in the morning trying to scout out locations with the best chance of no cloud cover, ultimately based on forecasts, we stayed home, making the right choice. For 2024 this wasn‚Äôt going to be an option, our house wasn‚Äôt in the path of totality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday evening I decided that Trail of Tears State Park outside of Jackson, MO would likely be our best choice, but I had a backup option of driving to a friend‚Äôs house in Illinois if something went wrong with the state park choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting down to the state park was relatively uneventful, morning traffic in St. Louis wasn‚Äôt too bad, though it did start to back up just before Festus going south, for what I believe was construction. We ended up hopping off the highway and taking 61 for about 8 miles before getting back on I-55 south. Other folks who left an hour or two later had a nightmare of non-stop traffic all the way south on I-55. We ended up getting to the park just before 10am and were able to find what I would estimate to be one of the final 20 spots available at the time. We parked down near the boatramp, which was perfect for us because our son was excited about fishing for a while in the Mississippi river while waiting for the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-setup&quot;&gt;Getting setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up deciding to watch the eclipse from right near our parked truck as opposed to finding a grassy spot to sit in. I wanted to keep our clear sky view and not have any trees blocking our view or any of the cameras I would be setting up. We packed lunch and snacks ahead of time, so beyond fishing and hitting the public restrooms we didn‚Äôt need to leave our spot for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the eclipse I would be shooting with 3 cameras, though only one really counted. I setup two GoPro cameras on tripods, one a Hero12 set to record video for the entirety of the eclipse. The other a Hero9 that I set on a timelapse, taking a photo every 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main rig for shooting the eclipse was my &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/43YUB1K&quot;&gt;Canon R5&lt;/a&gt;. For a lens I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3JkqUPh&quot;&gt;70-200m&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3W01HkS&quot;&gt;2X extender&lt;/a&gt; attached. I attached a solar filter (same one I used in 2017) to the lens hood with rubberbands, this allowed me to quickly remove the filter during totality to get unprotected shots of the eclipse. The filter I used was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vKdhG2&quot;&gt;8‚Äù Orion filter, though not as fancy as the ones currently on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three cameras were mounted on their own tripod, though none of them with any star trackers, maybe in the future I‚Äôll have one of those fancy tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-800-42ac113f9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eclipse Photo Camera Setup&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-200-42ac113f9.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-400-42ac113f9.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-800-42ac113f9.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-1600-42ac113f9.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-2000-42ac113f9.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;during-the-eclipse&quot;&gt;During the Eclipse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the event I was running back and forth between my R5 and the family. Trying to get a variety of shots, but also trying to spend time with the family as well. I had my camera setup on shutter priority (TV), which means I was targetting adjustment of primarily the shutterspeed for the event. I shot a variety of speeds from 1/5 (of a second) up to 1/8000, though a majority of the shots and what worked were between 1/640 and 1/2500. For my ISO I shot at 100 pretty much the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle I had during the eclipse was focusing. I tried setting auto-focus to on but for that to work you always have to be centered on the sun, and that‚Äôs very difficult to do when running on a tripod with a long lens/extender. You don‚Äôt realize how quickly the sun moves until you watch it though a zoom. So for focusing I manually focused, though the real struggle there was the solar filter. The way I had it mounted on the lens hood (without the hood extended) meant getting to the focus ring with my large hands was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up working with focus throughout the day, though I am not sure I was ever 100% happy with how I got it set, for the most part the photos worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;see-and-purchase-the-results&quot;&gt;See and Purchase The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the important part, the actual results! You can find the photos I have processed and chosen to post here on the page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/April-8th-2024-Total-Eclipse&quot;&gt;as well as in our high resolution gallery available here&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the shots I‚Äôve posted are during totality, though I have quite a few other stages. Bluntly, the other stages of the eclipse sort of get repetitive, while they make cool composition shots, I found them boring as individual shots so I didn‚Äôt post them for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll find in the shots a couple of composites, where I merged together multiple photos to create something unique. &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/April-8th-2024-Total-Eclipse&quot;&gt;All of these photos are available as prints, canvas and acrylics via our online gallery&lt;/a&gt;. If you‚Äôre interested in purchasing one of these photos in another format, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact&quot;&gt;please feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-need-to-experience-a-total-eclipse&quot;&gt;You need to experience a Total Eclipse!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiencing a Total Eclipse is a profound, almost mystical event. While a partial eclipse is certainly memorable, achieving totality transforms the experience entirely. It‚Äôs something you truly have to see for yourself to understand the full emotional and visual impact. People travel thousands of miles for just a few minutes of this celestial phenomenon, and once you‚Äôve witnessed it, you‚Äôll understand why. To get a taste of what I‚Äôm talking about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqN1OctY_30&quot;&gt;check out this captivating 7-minute, 4K video of the eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. Totality starts around 1:16, and you can hear the awe and excitement in the crowd‚Äôs reactions. It‚Äôs a preview of the exhilarating experience that awaits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-your-feedback&quot;&gt;Give your feedback!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback on our eclipse photos, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/rainbowmarksphoto&quot;&gt;feel free to follow along and comment on our photos over on our Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upcoming-eclipses-start-planning&quot;&gt;Upcoming Eclipses! Start Planning!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, the next five total solar eclipses will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12, 2026&lt;/strong&gt;: Visible in northern North America, western Africa, and Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2, 2027&lt;/strong&gt;: Visible in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, western and southern Asia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 22, 2028&lt;/strong&gt;: Visible in Southeast Asia, the East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 25, 2030&lt;/strong&gt;: Visible in southern Africa, the southern Indian Ocean, the East Indies, Australia, and Antarctica.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 30, 2033&lt;/strong&gt;: Visible in western Europe, northern Asia, North America, the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Arctic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
