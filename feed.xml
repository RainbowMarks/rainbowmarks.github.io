        <title>2024 Bommarito 500 IndyCar Photos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of once again getting to wander around World Wide Technology Raceway for the IndyCar event this weekend, the Bommarito 500! The race was held on August 17th, 2024 in Madison, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rainbowmarks.com/Events/2021/08/August-21-2021-IndyCar-Race-At-WWT-Raceway&quot;&gt;My first IndyCar experience was back in 2021&lt;/a&gt; and this time hoped to improve on the shots I took during that race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to have access to the VIP suites building and planted myself on the top of the roof for the start of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I wandered down into the infield and spent the majority of the race along the fence in turn 3. Many of the turn 3 shots are fairly repetitive but I was over there trying to see what I could make the camera do and how the setting sun would effect things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the race I made my way back over near the front straight to see if I could get anywhere close to the finish for some shots but ended up not getting anything there worth posting, perhaps next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the gallery we have a handful of shots, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Bommarito-500&quot;&gt;check out the main gallery for 200 photos from the race&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Tire Rack SCCA Solo Nationals Photos</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-check-out-our-2024-solo-nationals-photo-announcement-post&quot;&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rainbowmarks.com/Events/2024/09/SoloNationalsGallery/&quot;&gt;Check out our 2024 Solo Nationals Photo Announcement Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready, motorsport enthusiasts! RainbowMarks Photography is thrilled to announce our coverage of the 2024 Tire Rack SCCA Solo Nationals in Lincoln, Nebraska. This iconic event is the pinnacle of Solo competition, and we‚Äôre geared up to capture the high-octane action from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rainbowmarks.square.site/product/2024-solo-nationals/4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-800-8cffccc6d.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-200-8cffccc6d.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-400-8cffccc6d.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-800-8cffccc6d.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-1600-8cffccc6d.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-2000-8cffccc6d.jpg 2000w&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capturing-every-moment&quot;&gt;Capturing Every Moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôll be on-site shooting as many competition runs as possible across the four days of the event. Our focus is on action shots that showcase the speed, precision, and thrill of Solo racing. Whether you‚Äôre a competitor looking to relive your best runs or a fan wanting to see the action up close, we‚Äôve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-event-special-package-no-longer-available-at-discount&quot;&gt;Pre-Event Special Package (NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT DISCOUNT)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want comprehensive coverage of their performance, we‚Äôre offering an exclusive &lt;strong&gt;Pre-Event Special Package&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$125&lt;/strong&gt; for every one of our published digital photos of your car from the 2024 Solo Nationals. (Individual photos will be $25/photo after the event)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Automatically sorted, tagged and filtered photos for you and your car, no need to ‚Äúsearch‚Äù through photos after the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We‚Äôll be specifically shooting cars that have prepaid! We will guarantee at least 5 individual photos for you (likely many more), or your money back! Everyone else comes second, we may or may not get photos of them!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25% Discount on any Physical Orders (coupon code will be provided via email after 2024 Solo Nationals galleries are posted)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ProSolo Finale shots can be included for an additional &lt;strong&gt;$50&lt;/strong&gt; even after the Finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;years-of-solo-nationals-photo-experience&quot;&gt;Years of Solo Nationals Photo Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started attending the Solo Nationals in 2000. Throughout the years I‚Äôve taken thousands upon thousands of competition photos at the event. &lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/search/?user_id=17726343%40N00&amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;text=nationals&quot;&gt;Check out some of the past years work in our Flickr Galleries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-event-photo-availability&quot;&gt;Post-Event Photo Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to purchase photos after the event, individual photos will be available for &lt;strong&gt;$25/photo&lt;/strong&gt;. However, securing the pre-event package guarantees you receive all available photos at a significant discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;important-note&quot;&gt;Important Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of right now, we will be running and working the final heat each day, which may limit our ability to shoot cars competing in those classes. We‚Äôll do our best to capture as much as we can, but please be aware of this potential limitation. If you purchase and we don‚Äôt get any shots of you, a refund can be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contact-us&quot;&gt;Contact Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need to provide us with your car details, feel free to reach out before the event. We‚Äôre excited to capture the excitement of Solo Nationals and can‚Äôt wait to see you in Lincoln!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned to RainbowMarks Photography for more updates as we get closer to the event. Let‚Äôs make this year‚Äôs Solo Nationals one to remember!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Miner Tough Weekend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Year four! of shooting the Miner Tough weekend down in St. Joe State Park here in Missouri kicked off with Trail Run on Saturday July 13th, 2024, followed by the Mountain Bike Race on Sunday July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year, the event chose to have our photo services available for everyone to have access to free photo downloads! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend&quot;&gt;find the photos from the Miner Tough Weekend events now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll find three different galleries, I tried to get a photo of every entrant but likely missed a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Saturday-Trail-Run&quot;&gt;Trail Run on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Sunday-Mountain-Bike-Race&quot;&gt;Mountain Bike Race on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Sunday-MTB-GoPro-Randomness&quot;&gt;GoPro random shots from the MTB Race&lt;/a&gt; The camera was sitting next to a tree taking a photo every second. If you happened to pass at the right time to get in the frame and the photo wasn‚Äôt the blurriest thing ever created you might find yourself in these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like you can order prints from our online galleries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to the event organizers for having us out again this year!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Big Foot Open House</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the very first blog posts on this website, from back in 2019, was for the &lt;a href=&quot;/Events/2019/09/Big-Foot-Open-House&quot;&gt;2018 Big Foot Open House&lt;/a&gt;. Six years later I finally made it back out to the Big Foot Open House in Pacific Missouri and took more photos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm fond of High Roller II, so I went with the intention of taking some great pictures of the Krekeler‚Äôs Ford Ranger, but I managed to also get quite a few other trucks while I was out there this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 5 photos I have highlighted here on this blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/2024-Big-Foot-Open-House&quot;&gt;you can find the full gallery of 154 pictures over here&lt;/a&gt;. As with most of our galleries, you can purchase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a busy morning with central states hockey tryouts for my boy first thing, after dropping him off at home for a well earned day of rest, I headed south to Pacific. We spend quite a bit of time in Pacific with ice hockey and a couple of meetings with a client from work, but some of the most fun you can have in Pacific is visiting the Big Foot 4x4 Headquarters! I arrived sometime after 11am or so and parking was up to the Walgreens right on the main drag in town. I parked in the first grassy spot I could find and walked down to the open house event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival I dropped off some prints I made for the owner of High Roller II, some of which I will hopefully upgrade with the recent photos taken today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after I arrived Big Foot 15 headed out for a few car crush/jump passes around the fenced off field. I hadn‚Äôt really set myself up to get great shots for this first set of runs as the crown was 5 or 6 people deep from the fence when I did manage to walk around to the side of the field. Thankfully I‚Äôm tall enough that I was able to shoot over most of the people, and crop out the heads of those I didn‚Äôt on the shots of BF15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they finished their run most of the crowd cleared out so I moved up to the fence line to make sure I had the angle on the old school car crush that I knew was going to happen soon. My persistance paid off with the shots you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/2024-Big-Foot-Open-House&quot;&gt;in the gallery of 154 shots from today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you attend the Big Foot Open House? What did you think of things this year? The only thing I could suggest, is maybe a water truck next year, put some dampness down on the field and cut down on some of the dust! Now let me go clean my camera off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you enjoy the old school car crush?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was your favorite monster truck there this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it the Ford of Big Foot 15? The two dodges, Blue Ox and The Blaine Crusher? What about the lone Chevy Waldo? Or maybe it was one of the Fords,  Old Red Truck, Juggernaut Racing or High Roller II?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spirit of St. Louis Air Show &amp; STEM Expo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm an Air Force brat, that means I love air shows, so when the Spirit of St. Louis Air Show &amp;amp; STEM Expo come to town every 2 years I am in heaven for the week. I am fortunate enough to live close enough to the airport that I often see performers fly over my house when they arrive and when they are practicing on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was no different, after getting back from our trip to NYC super early on Thursday morning I was pleasantly notified by my wife around 10am on Thursday that jets were up and flying. I was able to step outside and see the Boeing F-15EX (or was it a QA?) flying over, close enough that I could snap a decent photo with my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the afternoon Thursday running in and out of the house camera in hand trying to get photos of planes as they flew over while simultaneously trying to get work done throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday I was able to view quite a bit of the practice flights that occurred from up off of Wildhorse Creek road in Chesterfield. Saturday I spent the entire day in a spot at the air show just beyond the end of the runway at Spirit Airport to catch the performers in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 4 days I took nearly thirteen thousand photos, I have spent a considerable amount of time culling down to a manageable list of photos that I thought could be published, you can find over 300 for your viewing pleasure in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Spirit-Of-St-Louis-Air-Show-Stem-Expo&quot;&gt;online gallery&lt;/a&gt; with just a few of those featured in the gallery here on this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we work on some special print discounts from the Air Show later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>April 8th 2024 Eclipse from Trail of Tears State Park in Jackson, Missouri</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After experiencing the Total Eclipse passing over our home in Wildwood Missouri in 2017, we vowed as a family we would watch the next one together! For the 2017 event our oldest daughter was at school that day, maybe 1/2 mile away, but not with us. For the 2024 Eclipse we pulled both kids from school and hit the road just after 7am to head towards the path of totality. I was fearful of crazy traffic, but we left early enough that we avoided the morning chaos that would follow on I-55 southbound from St. Louis later in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-a-place-to-watch-the-eclipse&quot;&gt;Finding a place to watch the eclipse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a few evenings trying to determine where to watch the eclipse from. I had a couple of criteria when searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As much totality as possible: We were lucky that within a 2 hours drive south or east, we could find locations in the path of totality that had over 4 minutes of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear skies: Both for weather and line of sight to the sun. There are a lot of places in Missouri where the sun can be blocked by the trees, finding a clear line of sight was important.
Sunday the 7th I spent a few hours pouring over potential locations and weather forecasts. I did something similar in 2017, waking up a few times early in the morning trying to scout out locations with the best chance of no cloud cover, ultimately based on forecasts, we stayed home, making the right choice. For 2024 this wasn‚Äôt going to be an option, our house wasn‚Äôt in the path of totality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday evening I decided that Trail of Tears State Park outside of Jackson, MO would likely be our best choice, but I had a backup option of driving to a friend‚Äôs house in Illinois if something went wrong with the state park choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting down to the state park was relatively uneventful, morning traffic in St. Louis wasn‚Äôt too bad, though it did start to back up just before Festus going south, for what I believe was construction. We ended up hopping off the highway and taking 61 for about 8 miles before getting back on I-55 south. Other folks who left an hour or two later had a nightmare of non-stop traffic all the way south on I-55. We ended up getting to the park just before 10am and were able to find what I would estimate to be one of the final 20 spots available at the time. We parked down near the boatramp, which was perfect for us because our son was excited about fishing for a while in the Mississippi river while waiting for the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-setup&quot;&gt;Getting setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up deciding to watch the eclipse from right near our parked truck as opposed to finding a grassy spot to sit in. I wanted to keep our clear sky view and not have any trees blocking our view or any of the cameras I would be setting up. We packed lunch and snacks ahead of time, so beyond fishing and hitting the public restrooms we didn‚Äôt need to leave our spot for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the eclipse I would be shooting with 3 cameras, though only one really counted. I setup two GoPro cameras on tripods, one a Hero12 set to record video for the entirety of the eclipse. The other a Hero9 that I set on a timelapse, taking a photo every 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main rig for shooting the eclipse was my &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/43YUB1K&quot;&gt;Canon R5&lt;/a&gt;. For a lens I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3JkqUPh&quot;&gt;70-200m&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3W01HkS&quot;&gt;2X extender&lt;/a&gt; attached. I attached a solar filter (same one I used in 2017) to the lens hood with rubberbands, this allowed me to quickly remove the filter during totality to get unprotected shots of the eclipse. The filter I used was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vKdhG2&quot;&gt;8‚Äù Orion filter, though not as fancy as the ones currently on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three cameras were mounted on their own tripod, though none of them with any star trackers, maybe in the future I‚Äôll have one of those fancy tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-800-42ac113f9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eclipse Photo Camera Setup&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-200-42ac113f9.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-400-42ac113f9.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-800-42ac113f9.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-1600-42ac113f9.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/eclipse/Equipment-1-2000-42ac113f9.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;during-the-eclipse&quot;&gt;During the Eclipse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the event I was running back and forth between my R5 and the family. Trying to get a variety of shots, but also trying to spend time with the family as well. I had my camera setup on shutter priority (TV), which means I was targetting adjustment of primarily the shutterspeed for the event. I shot a variety of speeds from 1/5 (of a second) up to 1/8000, though a majority of the shots and what worked were between 1/640 and 1/2500. For my ISO I shot at 100 pretty much the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle I had during the eclipse was focusing. I tried setting auto-focus to on but for that to work you always have to be centered on the sun, and that‚Äôs very difficult to do when running on a tripod with a long lens/extender. You don‚Äôt realize how quickly the sun moves until you watch it though a zoom. So for focusing I manually focused, though the real struggle there was the solar filter. The way I had it mounted on the lens hood (without the hood extended) meant getting to the focus ring with my large hands was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up working with focus throughout the day, though I am not sure I was ever 100% happy with how I got it set, for the most part the photos worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;see-and-purchase-the-results&quot;&gt;See and Purchase The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the important part, the actual results! You can find the photos I have processed and chosen to post here on the page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/April-8th-2024-Total-Eclipse&quot;&gt;as well as in our high resolution gallery available here&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the shots I‚Äôve posted are during totality, though I have quite a few other stages. Bluntly, the other stages of the eclipse sort of get repetitive, while they make cool composition shots, I found them boring as individual shots so I didn‚Äôt post them for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll find in the shots a couple of composites, where I merged together multiple photos to create something unique. &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/April-8th-2024-Total-Eclipse&quot;&gt;All of these photos are available as prints, canvas and acrylics via our online gallery&lt;/a&gt;. If you‚Äôre interested in purchasing one of these photos in another format, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chrishammond.com/Contact&quot;&gt;please feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-need-to-experience-a-total-eclipse&quot;&gt;You need to experience a Total Eclipse!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiencing a Total Eclipse is a profound, almost mystical event. While a partial eclipse is certainly memorable, achieving totality transforms the experience entirely. It‚Äôs something you truly have to see for yourself to understand the full emotional and visual impact. People travel thousands of miles for just a few minutes of this celestial phenomenon, and once you‚Äôve witnessed it, you‚Äôll understand why. To get a taste of what I‚Äôm talking about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqN1OctY_30&quot;&gt;check out this captivating 7-minute, 4K video of the eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. Totality starts around 1:16, and you can hear the awe and excitement in the crowd‚Äôs reactions. It‚Äôs a preview of the exhilarating experience that awaits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-your-feedback&quot;&gt;Give your feedback!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback on our eclipse photos, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/rainbowmarksphoto&quot;&gt;feel free to follow along and comment on our photos over on our Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NASA PACE Falcon 9 Rocket Launch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In February of 2024, I had the pleasure of spending some time in Florida for a work conference. While there, I kept an eye on the forecast and space launch schedule to see if I might catch a rocket launch while in town. SpaceX was planning to launch a Falcon 9 with the NASA PACE payload. The launch ended up being delayed for 3 days, finally happening early in the morning on February 8th, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not a publicly accessible launch, and I‚Äôm not sure why, but my assumption is that Falcon 9 launches are getting so frequent nowadays that late night/early morning launches are too much work from an organization perspective to try to allow the public access to the Cape to see launches. So, what does this mean? The public can still watch; they just have to do it from remote locations, not on the Cape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-0-800-d92b355ad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mission Control Morrell Operations Center Entry&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-0-200-d92b355ad.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-0-400-d92b355ad.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-0-800-d92b355ad.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-0-1600-d92b355ad.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-0-2000-d92b355ad.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-1-800-d20ce17ef.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mission Control Morrell Operations Center Display&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-1-200-d20ce17ef.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-1-400-d20ce17ef.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-1-800-d20ce17ef.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-1-1600-d20ce17ef.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-1-2000-d20ce17ef.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did I watch the launch? I was fortunate enough to be invited to join a couple of remote family members who live and even work on the Cape, so I got special access. The morning started out with a quick tour of Mission Control, yes, Mission Control for the launch! There are actually two different rooms for MC, one for the active launch, and one for anything else going on or tours, so we got to walk through the empty mission control room and look into the active room. With Falcon 9 launches, the number of people in mission control is pretty minimal, which was surprising to see considering what was occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-2-800-77caf8f5b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mission Control at Morrell Operations Center with Me!&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-2-200-77caf8f5b.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-2-400-77caf8f5b.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-2-800-77caf8f5b.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-2-1600-77caf8f5b.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-2-2000-77caf8f5b.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-3-800-22a541a5e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mission Control at Morrell Operations Center&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-3-200-22a541a5e.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-3-400-22a541a5e.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-3-800-22a541a5e.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-3-1600-22a541a5e.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-3-2000-22a541a5e.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the best part about the Mission Control tour? The laugh I got in the bathroom! Check out this sign. If the people who are launching rockets into space can‚Äôt even hit the toilet, how are they going to land on Mars? (sorry, I couldn‚Äôt resist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-4-800-93b5aef0b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mission Control Urinals&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-4-200-93b5aef0b.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-4-400-93b5aef0b.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-4-800-93b5aef0b.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-4-1600-93b5aef0b.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/space/nasapace/MissionControl-4-2000-93b5aef0b.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the launch itself. I won‚Äôt share exact details on where we were for the launch, but boy was that an experience! This Falcon 9 rocket was launching towards the south, something that a NASA payload hadn‚Äôt done in 50+ years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor-Ablestar&quot;&gt;the last time on November 30th, 1960, having a problem during launch and rumored to kill a cow in Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. After the launch, and I mean, almost right after, like 7 minutes, the rocket would come back and land also on the Cape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were set up to watch the launch, knowing that we didn‚Äôt have the best spot to view the landing pad, but had thoughts of maybe trying to drive over to catch the landing. Long story short, we didn‚Äôt make it over to see the landing, we took too long watching the launch and nearly missed the landing altogether as we were driving west towards it when the sky lit up with what looked like lightning then the sun as the rocket reignited for landing along with sonic booms as it broke the sound barrier. I managed to stick the camera out the window of the SUV and got a shot or two, but nothing great of the landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience, it had been 14 years since I saw my first shuttle launch, also a night launch with access to the Cape from an employee. This launch had a little less excitement as the Shuttle launch we had to rush to get on the bus to depart our viewing location because of the risk of an acid cloud blowing back at us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt wait for my next launch, and definitely am taking my family with me next time so they can experience it too!&lt;/p&gt;
