        <title>Capturing the Action: Missouri Youth Hockey Photos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a photographer, I’ve spent the past five years immersed in the fast-paced, adrenaline-filled world of youth hockey. Shooting youth hockey games across Missouri has become a passion of mine, combining my love for sports, photography, and storytelling. In this post, I want to share my experience capturing these unforgettable moments and some tips for parents and fans looking to preserve memories of their favorite players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thrill-of-youth-hockey&quot;&gt;The Thrill of Youth Hockey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missouri youth hockey is full of energy, determination, and heart. Whether it’s a young goalie making an incredible save, a forward scoring the game-winning goal, or players cheering each other on after a tough period, the spirit of these athletes is inspiring. Every game tells its own story, and my goal as a photographer is to capture the essence of those stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-shooting-hockey&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Shooting Hockey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hockey is one of the most challenging sports to photograph. The speed of the game, the unpredictable action, and the reflections from the ice and glass all require a skilled hand and the right gear. Over the years, I’ve fine-tuned my approach to deal with these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear&lt;/strong&gt;: I primarily use a Canon EOS R5 paired with a fast telephoto lens to freeze the action. For poorly lit rinks, my gear’s ability to perform well in low light has been crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;: High shutter speeds (1/640 or faster), wide apertures, and ISO adjustments are essential to capturing crisp shots in dimly lit arenas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positioning&lt;/strong&gt;: Knowing where to stand is just as important as technical skills. Being at the right angle for a shot—whether it’s behind the net, at center ice, or near the benches—makes all the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moments-that-matter&quot;&gt;Moments That Matter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes youth hockey special are the moments of pure joy and camaraderie. Some of my favorite shots over the years include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A goalie’s celebration after their team clinched a championship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A team’s huddle before a big game, reflecting their determination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Players sharing high-fives and laughter after a well-fought match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t just pictures—they’re memories. I love knowing that the images I capture will be cherished by families for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips-for-parents-capturing-hockey-photos&quot;&gt;Tips for Parents Capturing Hockey Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a parent looking to take your own photos at the rink, here are a few tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Fast Shutter Speeds&lt;/strong&gt;: To avoid motion blur, set your camera to a high shutter speed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Faces&lt;/strong&gt;: Hockey is about emotion. Capturing the players’ expressions through their cages adds depth to your photos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Patient&lt;/strong&gt;: Hockey moves quickly, so wait for the right moment—a breakaway, a big save, or a celebration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Thoughtfully&lt;/strong&gt;: Post-processing can help bring out details, especially in challenging lighting conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-do-it&quot;&gt;Why I Do It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youth hockey photography is more than just a job; it’s a privilege. Being able to witness and document these young athletes’ growth, determination, and sportsmanship is truly rewarding. Over the years, I’ve seen players develop not just as athletes but as individuals, and I’m honored to be a part of preserving their journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in seeing my work or booking a session, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cjh.am/rbmcontact&quot;&gt;feel free to reach out&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s create lasting memories of your hockey star!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy shooting, and I’ll see you at the rink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Northern Lights over Missouri and the Mississipi River</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/Blog/2024/10/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights&quot;&gt;Yesterday I posted about how to take photos of the Northern Lights&lt;/a&gt;, here are the results of my own process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was a busy night. My wife has a dressage show this weekend, so I was doing the bachelor dad thing for the start of the evening. Running one kid to gymnastics and then taking the other to hockey practice. Before these two events I packed up all the camera gear I thought I was going to need for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hockey I grabbed a quick bite to eat and then transferred kid #2 to Natalie on her way home, and then I headed north. My goal was to try to get somewhere to see the northern lights with some water in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at dark sky maps I considered heading to Mark Twain Lake, but I was concerned that I wouldn’t be able to find a decent spot and that I would be too late by the time I got there. Instead, I headed up 79 towards Clarksville MO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way I looked up boat ramps and picked one in Clarksville. Upon arrival I decided there was too much extra light, so I continued one ramp north of Clarksville to a great little place (Silo Access Boat Ramp). When I pulled in, I realized it had some camping spots with a few folks in trailers and a car or two parked nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dark, and I was able to park pretty close to the Mississippi River. I quickly got out of the car and setup to take photos for a couple of hours. This aurora event was unlike any previous one I’ve experienced (2 in the past 18 months). It was amazing. As my eyes adjusted to the dark sky the lights and colors really started to pop. To the point that I was getting distracted trying to get the cameras setup to just look and take it all in visually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photos here are some of the selected photos taken on my Canon R5 with a 15-35mm lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a timelapse of those and more photos all together:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Photograph the Northern Lights: A Guide to Capturing Nature’s Spectacular Light Show</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent influx of solar activity the ability for more parts of the United States to see the Northern Lights (aurora borealis) has increased many times over the past year. We are in a peak phase of sun activity this year and may continue to have opportunities for the near future, but you never know, so if you’ve got an opportunity to get outside, do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/Blog/2024/10/northern-lights-over-missouri&quot;&gt;See some of the output from these tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are one of the most breathtaking natural phenomena to witness. Capturing them through photography, however, can be tricky due to the unique conditions and low-light environment. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to best photograph the Northern Lights and come home with stunning images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-choose-the-right-time-and-location&quot;&gt;1. Choose the Right Time and Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lights are most visible in areas close to the magnetic poles, such as Norway, Iceland, Alaska, and parts of Canada. Timing is key — the best chances for viewing occur during the winter months when the nights are longer and skies are clearer. It’s also important to check solar activity forecasts, as auroras are more intense during high solar activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Apps like My Aurora Forecast or websites like spaceweather.gov can help predict when the aurora will be active in your location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;october-2024-thoughts&quot;&gt;October 2024 thoughts:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event currently scheduled for October 10th and 11th 2024 may be visible from as far south in the US as Alabama. Everyone in the country should be thinking about getting outside these evenings to see if they can find the Northern Lights. There is no guarantee that you’ll see them, but you definitely won’t if you stay inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-essential-gear-for-northern-lights-photography&quot;&gt;2. Essential Gear for Northern Lights Photography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a fancy setup to capture the Northern Lights, but the right equipment will ensure your photos are sharp and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera:&lt;/strong&gt; A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual settings is ideal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lens:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a wide-angle lens (14-24mm) with a fast aperture (f/2.8 or lower) to capture as much of the sky as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tripod:&lt;/strong&gt; A sturdy tripod is a must. You’ll be shooting long exposures, so keeping the camera still is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Shutter or Timer:&lt;/strong&gt; To avoid camera shake, use a remote shutter or set a delay timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Bring extra batteries — cold weather can drain them quickly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-set-up-your-camera&quot;&gt;3. Set Up Your Camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding your camera’s settings is essential to photographing the Northern Lights. Since each aurora display varies in brightness and movement, experimenting with these settings will help you capture the perfect shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aperture:&lt;/strong&gt; Set your lens to its widest aperture (f/2.8 or lower) to allow maximum light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISO:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with an ISO of 800-1600. If the lights are faint, increase the ISO, but be careful not to introduce too much noise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shutter Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Adjust based on the intensity of the lights. A starting point is 5-15 seconds. If the aurora is moving fast, use shorter exposures (5-10 seconds) to avoid blurring the details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Manually set your focus to infinity or focus on a distant light source, such as stars or a faraway mountain. Use live view mode to fine-tune the sharpness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Take a few test shots and zoom in to ensure the stars are sharp. Autofocus often struggles in low light, so manual focus is usually best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-framing-and-composition&quot;&gt;4. Framing and Composition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Northern Lights are the stars of the show, incorporating foreground elements like trees, mountains, or water can make your images more dynamic. The key is balance — don’t let the foreground overpower the aurora, but use it to add depth and context to your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silhouettes:&lt;/strong&gt; A tree line or cabin can add drama without distracting from the lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflections:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re near a body of water, try to capture the reflection of the lights in the water for an added layer of beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Thirds:&lt;/strong&gt; Use this composition rule to position the horizon on the lower third of the frame, giving the sky more space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a headlamp with a red filter when setting up. Red light won’t impact your night vision as much as white light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-post-processing-tips&quot;&gt;5. Post-Processing Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve captured your photos, post-processing can help bring out the beauty of the aurora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Shooting at high ISOs can introduce noise, so use software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to reduce noise in your images.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast and Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhance the vibrancy and detail of the Northern Lights by adjusting the contrast, highlights, and shadows. Be careful not to over-edit and lose the natural look.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharpening:&lt;/strong&gt; A bit of sharpening can bring out the stars and details in the aurora.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-patience-and-perseverance&quot;&gt;6. Patience and Perseverance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lights are unpredictable. Sometimes they may appear for only a few minutes, while other times they could dance for hours. Be patient, keep shooting, and embrace the serenity of the experience. Often, the best shots come from waiting through long, cold nights for the perfect moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Always dress warmly and bring hot drinks or snacks to keep comfortable during long shooting sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographing the Northern Lights can be challenging but also immensely rewarding. With the right equipment, settings, and a bit of patience, you’ll be able to capture stunning images of one of nature’s most magical displays. Remember to enjoy the moment, as seeing the aurora with your own eyes is an unforgettable experience — the photos are just the icing on the cake!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Bommarito 500 IndyCar Photos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of once again getting to wander around World Wide Technology Raceway for the IndyCar event this weekend, the Bommarito 500! The race was held on August 17th, 2024 in Madison, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rainbowmarks.com/Events/2021/08/August-21-2021-IndyCar-Race-At-WWT-Raceway&quot;&gt;My first IndyCar experience was back in 2021&lt;/a&gt; and this time hoped to improve on the shots I took during that race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to have access to the VIP suites building and planted myself on the top of the roof for the start of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I wandered down into the infield and spent the majority of the race along the fence in turn 3. Many of the turn 3 shots are fairly repetitive but I was over there trying to see what I could make the camera do and how the setting sun would effect things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the race I made my way back over near the front straight to see if I could get anywhere close to the finish for some shots but ended up not getting anything there worth posting, perhaps next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the gallery we have a handful of shots, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Bommarito-500&quot;&gt;check out the main gallery for 200 photos from the race&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rainbowmarks.square.site/product/2024-solo-nationals/4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-800-8cffccc6d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buy now&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-200-8cffccc6d.jpg 200w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-400-8cffccc6d.jpg 400w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-800-8cffccc6d.jpg 800w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-1600-8cffccc6d.jpg 1600w, /generated/img/posts/2024/august/BlogPostPre/buynow-2000-8cffccc6d.jpg 2000w&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capturing-every-moment&quot;&gt;Capturing Every Moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be on-site shooting as many competition runs as possible across the four days of the event. Our focus is on action shots that showcase the speed, precision, and thrill of Solo racing. Whether you’re a competitor looking to relive your best runs or a fan wanting to see the action up close, we’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-event-special-package-no-longer-available-at-discount&quot;&gt;Pre-Event Special Package (NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT DISCOUNT)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want comprehensive coverage of their performance, we’re offering an exclusive &lt;strong&gt;Pre-Event Special Package&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$125&lt;/strong&gt; for every one of our published digital photos of your car from the 2024 Solo Nationals. (Individual photos will be $25/photo after the event)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This package includes all photos, no matter how many drivers or classes the car is entered in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically sorted, tagged and filtered photos for you and your car, no need to “search” through photos after the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ll be specifically shooting cars that have prepaid! We will guarantee at least 5 individual photos for you (likely many more), or your money back! Everyone else comes second, we may or may not get photos of them!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25% Discount on any Physical Orders (coupon code will be provided via email after 2024 Solo Nationals galleries are posted)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ProSolo Finale shots can be included for an additional &lt;strong&gt;$50&lt;/strong&gt; even after the Finale!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;years-of-solo-nationals-photo-experience&quot;&gt;Years of Solo Nationals Photo Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started attending the Solo Nationals in 2000. Throughout the years I’ve taken thousands upon thousands of competition photos at the event. &lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/search/?user_id=17726343%40N00&amp;amp;view_all=1&amp;amp;text=nationals&quot;&gt;Check out some of the past years work in our Flickr Galleries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-event-photo-availability&quot;&gt;Post-Event Photo Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to purchase photos after the event, individual photos will be available for &lt;strong&gt;$25/photo&lt;/strong&gt;. However, securing the pre-event package guarantees you receive all available photos at a significant discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;important-note&quot;&gt;Important Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of right now, we will be running and working the final heat each day, which may limit our ability to shoot cars competing in those classes. We’ll do our best to capture as much as we can, but please be aware of this potential limitation. If you purchase and we don’t get any shots of you, a refund can be given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contact-us&quot;&gt;Contact Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need to provide us with your car details, feel free to reach out before the event. We’re excited to capture the excitement of Solo Nationals and can’t wait to see you in Lincoln!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned to RainbowMarks Photography for more updates as we get closer to the event. Let’s make this year’s Solo Nationals one to remember!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce that the photo galleries from the 2024 American Water Missouri River 340 are now available for viewing and purchasing! Dive into the memories and relive the race through our extensive collection of photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷 Check out the galleries here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/MR340&quot;&gt;2024 MR340 Gallery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚤 For Pre-Order Customers: Use the Search feature on the gallery by boat number to easily find your photos from the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔍 For Everyone Else: Over the next few days, I’ll be manually tagging boats I can identify. In the meantime, feel free to browse through the galleries to find your boat. &lt;em&gt;(Update, AI has made an attempt to tag every photo that had a visible number.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💻 Photo Downloads: The easiest option for getting your race photos is through digital downloads. However, a variety of print formats are also available!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 Custom Processing: Want custom processing, cropping, or color adjustments? This service is available for an additional cost and must be handled manually. Please reach out to rainbowmarks@christoc.com for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙏 Thank You: Thank you all for your patience! As a single photographer doing my best to shoot the entire race with very little sleep, if I missed you or your boat, my sincerest apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Miner Tough Weekend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Year four! of shooting the Miner Tough weekend down in St. Joe State Park here in Missouri kicked off with Trail Run on Saturday July 13th, 2024, followed by the Mountain Bike Race on Sunday July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year, the event chose to have our photo services available for everyone to have access to free photo downloads! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend&quot;&gt;find the photos from the Miner Tough Weekend events now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find three different galleries, I tried to get a photo of every entrant but likely missed a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Saturday-Trail-Run&quot;&gt;Trail Run on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Sunday-Mountain-Bike-Race&quot;&gt;Mountain Bike Race on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Miner-Tough-Weekend/Sunday-MTB-GoPro-Randomness&quot;&gt;GoPro random shots from the MTB Race&lt;/a&gt; The camera was sitting next to a tree taking a photo every second. If you happened to pass at the right time to get in the frame and the photo wasn’t the blurriest thing ever created you might find yourself in these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like you can order prints from our online galleries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to the event organizers for having us out again this year!&lt;/p&gt;
