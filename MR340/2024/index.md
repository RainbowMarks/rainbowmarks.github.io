    <p>RainbowMarks Photography is happy to be back at the MR340 as the Official Photographer of the race!</p>
    <p>
    We are working on our photo package options for 2024. We will be at the starting line, and then various stops or check points along the race route to catch photos throughout the race. We will also attempt to be at the finish line for every boat that crosses the line in St. Charles, Missouri. </p>

    <h3>Can I pre-pay for photos?</h3>
    <p>While we did a prepaid package last year, we haven't quite decided if we will do that same thing again this year or not. </p>
