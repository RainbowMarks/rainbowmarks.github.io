RainbowMarks.com Repository 
====================

RainbowMarks Photography out of Wildwood, Missouri.

Notes for Chris: Need to update the GENERATED folder, copied from the local _site/generated folder occassionally. Otherwise the builds in GitHub actions take longer and longer as more images are uploaded. By building locally first, copying the folder over, then pushing to GIT builds are faster.
